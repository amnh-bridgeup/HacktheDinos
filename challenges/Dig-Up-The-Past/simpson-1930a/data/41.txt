62	This is the Bed Y of various 
profiles (A, I, J, K, L, M, N), 
generally about 100' ? 120' above the 
Argiles Fissilaires.  It is a tuff,
often massive pure and white, 
elsewhere less pure and pinkish, in 
one or two places with manganese 
stains, but almost always forming a 
prominent salient.  The base is usually
sharp + somewhat undulating, the upper 
part grades variously into less pure 
tuffs.  Not far above it there is 
usually a yellowish band. Fossils 
occur in and immediately above this,
also at various levels below for a 
maximum of about 130!
"Lower Channel":
	The top of the Notostylopense 
depends on laboratory study, but it 
appears in the field that it may be 
below another fairly continuous bed, 
marked "LOWER CHANNEL SERIES"
In Profile A, G + X in I + J.  
At its base near A it has a heavy 
conglomerate, with
numerous fragmentary fossils.  
Traced continuously eastward it 
changes character + becomes a pink 
tuff which may or may not be 
unconformable on beds below. Still 
farther east it cannot be traced 
continuously but there are
other pink beds and channel beds 
(as in + near prof. M) which may be 
the same. It doesn't contain very good 
fossils, but we have identifiable 
specimens from many points which 
should clear it up.  Its fauna
seems unlike that of any beds below.
It may be:
