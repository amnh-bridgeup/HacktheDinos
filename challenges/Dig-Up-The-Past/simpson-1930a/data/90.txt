REMARKS ON CAÑADÓN HONDO  155 
(all the remarks that are fit to print) 
 Cañadón Hondo is remarkably 
confusing and no clear idea of 
its geology can be obtained short 
of a detailed survey.  Its great 
size, very complex 
and obscure structure 
with numerous faults and folds, the 
discontinuity of 
exposures or structures 
at critical points, the lenticular 
nature of the beds, the strangeness of 
their facies, and the general paucity 
of fossils make any very definite 
conclusions impossible. 
  Aside from the Patagoniano, which 
is always readily 
recognizable and usually 
confined to the 
higher rim (an exception 
in profile CE), the following types 
of sediments occur: 
  1.  More or less massive white, pink, 
or rarely yellowish tuffs, with some 
tuffaceous clay. 
  2.  Pale green, occasionally 
highly silicified and often very 
concretionary tuffs 
intercalated with bright green clay. 
  3.  Green clay with spots and 
poorly sorted pebbles, associated with 
bright green sands and, rarely, white
