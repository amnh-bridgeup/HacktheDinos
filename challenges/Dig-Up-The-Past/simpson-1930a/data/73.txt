122	SE Faldeo of Pampa Pelada. 
 
This section, indicated 
	to us by Piátnitzky + 
	visited with him, 
	shows marine trans- 
	gression over the 
	Mammal-bearing tuffs 
	on the  NW side of the 
	Rio Chico, where Ameg- 
	hino says it does not 
	occur. 
	A is unquestionably 
	part of the Notostylops- 
	Pyrotherium series, but the 
	few bones found were not 
	identified.  B is a tuff 
	similar to those below, but 
	is marine (a fact first 
	established by our visit- 
	P. + Feruglio believed it 
	terrestrial).  D is 
	obviously marine.
