4.  In a really continuous section, 
the supposed plane of erosion covered 
by Notostylopense is never seen.  On 
the contrary, the beds which actually 
lie in the main barrancas at the top 
of the a.f. are invariably parallel
to those above.  In the rarer cases 
where lower Notostylopense is preserved
in the tilted blocks, it is also tilted
+ still parallel to the a.f.


The 4th fact seems to remove all 
evidence for the supposed post-a.f. + 
pre-notost. folding[explanation A] 
proposed by Keidel, Windhausen. The 
claimed angular unconformity is here 
a mere illusion, vanishing when the 
Beds are more closely studied.
	The other observed facts, while
not absolutely conclusive, involve so 
many coincidences that the very 
strongly point to C as the true 
hypothesis: that this steep folding +
faulting is not an ancient + tectonic 
feature extending to the subsurface but
is directly related to the present 
topography + purely superficial: that 
the wet plastic clays of the Upper 
Pehuenche have been incompetent to
support the blocks of (originally) 
nearly horizontal arg. fis. outstanding
from the bases of these barrancas
and that large sections of the arg. 
fis. have thus moved by gravity 
slumping on this plastic base, their 
lower parts generally moving down
the slope away from the barrancas, 
tilting the blocks more or less sharply
and breaking them.
