transition, but this would leave only 
35'-40' for the Pehuenche, which is 
extremely unlikely, or suppose the 
presence of a fault, also 
unlikely as the "arg. fis." extend up 
the Pehuenche slope in places. 
  In profile AB at least the lower 
120' are Chubutiano and at least the 
upper 135' below the argiles fis. are 
Pehuenche.  The intervening beds are 
doubtful. I could find neither a 
typical "Banco verde" nor a typical 
"Banco negro."  The latter may be 
represented by the thin lens 
of black clay ? but this is highly 
uncertain. 
  In any event there is here a series 
chiefly of clay and sand + without any 
apparent important break in the lower 
part of which there are dinosaurs, + 
in the upper part of which there are 
no bones. The highest bones are ca. 
310' below the 
arg. fis., the highest bones surely of 
dinosaurs, ca. 360'. 
  Arg. Fis.:  Neither the thickness 
nor the bedding of the arg. fis. can 
be determined in section AA ? in at 
least one place slumping + patchy 
silicification makes the bedding seem 
to be at a sharp angle to that of beds 
above + below, but I am sure this is 
wrong.  It is evident that the 
thickness is less than along the rim 
of the Valle Hermoso.  In section AB 
 
 
CERRO DEL HUMO			89 
280.  Lower jaw of Pyrotherium. 
Profile, p. 81.  The exposure is 
isolated + a small fault, throw ca. 
25', may but does not surely pass near
by.  The jaw is surely from within 15'
either above or below the bed marked 
on profile, not surely defineable more 
closely.  J.H.  (G.G.S. coll.). 
12/9/30.  1 block, 2 packages. 
 
281.	A.  Ungulate jaw. 29417 
B. Similar, nearby, possibly assoc. 
29418 
C.  3 incisors in jaw frag, very near 
      B + prob. assoc.  29419 
      - All from one quarry, 
       level as #279. 
G.G.S.  12/9/30.  
1 block each = 3 blocks. 
 
282.  A.  Ungulate jaw.  29403 
         B.  Similar jaw.  29421 
 - From one quarry, 
   not same loc. as 279 or 
281 but about same level.  See #279. 
J.H.  12/8/30.  
1 block each = 2 blocks. 
 
283.  Various teeth, etc.  As #279. 
G.G.S. + C.S.W.  12/9/30.  1 package.

284.  Broken skull.  See profile p.85. 
Horizon not exactly fixed.  
At least 30' 
below "Lower Quarries" and 
probably more. 
Very probably the same 
white tuff as that 
Marked on profile.  J.H.  12/12/30.
