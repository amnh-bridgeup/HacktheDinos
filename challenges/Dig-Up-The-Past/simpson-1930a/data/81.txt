134	Notes, Profile CC. 
  This section contains no 
identifiable 
fossils, but is of stratigraphic + 
tectonic interest. 
  The fault shown has an average 
dip of about 65°, strike roughly NE- 
SW, throw 30' or a little more.  It is
 truncated by unfaulted Patagoniano. 
Thus there is a well defined period of 
tectonic disturbance and of erosion 
before the Patagoniano and after the 
pink tuff (not yet dated but probable 
Pyrotherium beds), although the beds 
are Nearly parallel. 
  The basal plane of the Patagoniano, 
as seen in section, is almost flat, 
very sharp.  Numerous borings, up to 
¾" in diameter and 4" long, mostly 
of this form:    and full of cemented 
	        [Spec. I4]. 
sand extend from the plane of 
unconformity down into the tuff. 
  There is no transition from tuffs 
to Patagoniano, but a sharp division 
representing a distinct hiatus.
