50 NOTES ON COLI-HUAPI PROFILES.

Pehuenche:  The Salamanqueano is not 
exposed in
any continuous section with 
the barranca + the
Chubutiano occurs 
no nearer than the cliff east of the
Laguna.  The lowest beds exposed near 
the
barranca belong to the Pehuenche.  
The lower
part, poorly exposed, is 
chiefly of cross-bedded
variegated 
sands + gravels where visible, as in
the shore-cliff near Camp #1.  
At the foot of
the cliff, the upper 
part of the Pehuenche, it
consists 
chiefly of sombre variegated shales, 
soft
plastic clay when wet.  Some bone 
fragments
occur in this, but not 
identifiable even as to
class.  The 
contact with the argiles fissilaires
seems everywhere to be plane and 
parallel, although not very well 
exposed except to the
east.  It 
involves a brusque change in
lithology, but often when it can be 
followed  closely
there is a 
transitional zone of alternating Arg.
fis. + Pehuenche-type beds.  The 
possibility
of an unconformity is not 
excluded, however.


Argiles Fissilaires:  This problematic 
formation
here is formed by beds from 
100'-150' in thickness
intercalated 
between the Pehuenche and the
Notostylopense.  The contact with the 
Pehuenche
is fairly sharp and can be 
defined within a
few feet if not 
exactly.
  Wherever the two are seen in true 
continuity,
without intervening talus 
or soil, the bedding
planes of the arg.
 fis. + the notost. appear
to be 
absolutely parallel.  The transition 
also
is often gradual to such a point 
that the
top of the arg. fis. is 
difficult to fix
exactly.  Thus hard 
silicified beds or lenses
