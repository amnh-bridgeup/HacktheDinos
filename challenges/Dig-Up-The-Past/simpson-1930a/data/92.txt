158  but in general 2 lies above 
3. 
  In at least one place (profile CF, 
west, left, end) 3 seems clearly to 
overly 4.  Nevertheless as in CA 
and in the confused region between 
the Bird Clay + Monte Verde generally 
3 contains lenses of ss. similar to 4 
and it is probably that it grades 
laterally into sediments of the type 
of 4, at least partially. 
  From conditions such as are 
shown in profiles CA + CB it seems 
probable, again not proven, that 2 
underlies and also at least partially 
grades laterally into type 1. 
  A tentative hypothesis as to these 
relations, subject to 
study of the mammals 
etc. and far from established as fact, 
is shown on the next page:
