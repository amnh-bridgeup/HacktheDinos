164  almost invariably 
broken into small 
bits and water-worn.  
They are indubitably 
derived from the erosion 
of the underlying 
Pyrotherium beds. 
  3.  Aside from bones 
derived from 
the underlying beds, I 
found no fossils in 
this.  I believe it to 
be a freshwater series 
contemporary with or 
immediately preceding the 
earliest transgression 
of the Patagoniano 
sea. 
  4,5.  These beds are 
apparently con- 
temporaneous.  Both series 
contain very 
numerous fossils, mammals 
and birds, 
of Pyrotherium or 
Descado age.  They 
are of slightly different facies.  
The only 
difference noted in my very 
rapid study 
was that Pyrotherium 
itself is definitely 
more common in (perhaps 
even confined to) the 
channel facies. 
  6.  The surface of 6 
is, of course, covered 
with fragments washed 
down from the 
overlying Descado beds.  
There are definitely 
some fragmentary bones 
in place in 6, 
but we found no 
identifiable fossils 
surely in place.  The 
unconformity, 4, 5-6, 
suggests that 6 is 
definitely older, although 
not in itself disproving 
the possibility 
that the disconformity 
is local + the 
age difference slight.  
The discoveries 
 
 
 	165 
in section DB, however, 
strongly suggest 
that 6 belongs to the 
Notostylops age, 
Casamayor.

notes have been

of Loomis and are subject 
to revision

in our rapid study

longer and more detailed 
work at the

  Although it must 
always be possible to 
pick up a few good 
specimens at this 
locality, it definitely 
will not repay long- 
continued collecting at 
present.  Ameghino 
worked it.  Loomis 
obtained a magnificent 
collection which must 
have exhausted the 
beds temporarily and 
have made an equal 
crop impossible without 
many years of  
erosion.  Riggs also 
went over it thoroughly 
+ gathered the crop 
developed since Loomis. 
Other geologists visit 
it almost every year 
and pick up all the 
obvious things.  I found 
about 25 identifiable 
specimens, and probably 
exhaustive collection 
this year would not 
more than double that 
number.  Almost all
