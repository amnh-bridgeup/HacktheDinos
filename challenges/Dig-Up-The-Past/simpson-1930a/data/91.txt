  4.  Pale clays, massive, 
grey, pinkish, 
greenish, and fine to coarse x-bedded 
sands, usually white or grey, but 
often greenish or 
pink to red.  Although 
physically similar and not separable 
at present, these include two parts 
probably quite distinct in age: 
a.  An upper series in which 
the pillar bed and mammal sand- 
stone are intercalated. 
b.  A lower series including true 
Banco negro. 
 
  In (2), probably in its lower part 
only, are also seen two very special 
types: thin widespead 
white beds supposed 
in the field to be diatomaceous earth 
(profiles CA, CF), 
and finely laminated 
shales with local plants 
and fish (CF, also 
occurs although less 
prominently + without 
fossils in CA). 
  We have identifiable mammals from 
1,2, + 4a which should help to 
clear up the sequence. 
  This sequence is not certain 
in field observation, but appears 
to be in the order of the above 
list, top to bottom.

  1 clearly forms the 
top of the series, being 
the only type found near or at the 
contact with the Patagoniano and in 
general not occurring elsewhere. 
  4 similarly clearly forms the base. 
The presence of a much disturbed block 
of this type of sediment among the 
tuffs of type 1 (Profile CE) can only 
be due to faulting. 
  The relations of types 2 + 3 to 
each other + to 1 + 4 constitute the 
major problem.  Type 2 has a 
thickness of not less than 200' in 
profile CF, Type 3 not less than 
125' in profile CD.  The transition 
from 2 to 3 was nowhere clearly 
observed, being either 
obscure or along 
a clear or probable fault.  They 
often occur laterally 
at the same level, 
as in profile CA, 
but with such sudden 
change that they can hardly grade 
into one another directly in these 
cases, although they may do so to 
some extent in the series as a whole. 
It seems highly probable, not 
proven, that they intergrade somewhat
