52  may occur above the continuous
arg. fis. type of sediment, 
intercalated with
typical Tertiary-type.  Indeed 
silicified tuffs
with nodular concretions, identical 
in character
with the arg. fis., may occur even 
in the
upper part of the Tertiary series.
At other times tuffaceous clays 
similar in coloring to typical arg. 
fis. but not silicified may be 
intercalated between the two.
	These facts and some irregular
variation in the apparent thickness of
the Notostylopense below an identified
guide horizon ("Y") leads not to
the conclusion that they are 
unconformable, but on the contrary 
that they intergrade so perfectly that
the top of the arg. fis. cannot be
identified at the same level 
everywhere.  In fact it seems quite 
possible that the sharp distinction 
between typical (or rather extreme) 
arg. fis. + typical Tertiary is due 
less to original differences than to 
subsequent probably hydrothermal 
alteration of the arg. fis.  If this 
be true, the latter is merely a 
varying of the lower part of the 
post-Pehuenche sediments which have 
suffered alteration.  The stratigraphy
and paleontology of a locality where 
arg. fis. do not occur will help check
on this.
	The supposed post-Arg. fis, 
pre-Notostylopian folding is based on 
supposed angular unconformity between
the two.  The actual field conditions 
as observed SSE of Valle Hermoso 
station, (nr.  Cañadon Pedro), at
several points s. of Coli-Huapi + 
elsewhere on the north rim of the 
Valle Hermoso, + at the NE end of Pampa
 María  Sanhima, are as shown below
