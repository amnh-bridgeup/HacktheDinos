  A. ? The "Bird Clay", specimens 3..,
422, etc., is a hard, massive, bright 
green clay with intercalated bands of 
white tuff. The latter are irregular, 
due to compression of the clay which 
has also produced many small slips.  
Both clay + tuff contain numerous 
bones ? bird, turtle, crocodile.  The 
exposure is a stream bank, about 5' of 
the series exposed, neither overlying 
nor underlying beds in continuous 
exposure.  A concentration of bones at
the contact of clay + tuff is 
noticeable.  Rock specimens: 
58, 59. 
 
  B. ? This has slumped, producing 
irregular bedding.  
Its contact with the 
bird clay is nowhere visible. 
 
  C. ? Massive tuff, bedding not 
visible. Similar in appearance to B 
except absence 
of bedding + brighter color. 
 
  D. ? Massive impure tuff, with 
mammals, showing on one side of hill 
an irregular contact with equally 
massive clay. 
 
  E. ? A thick series, ±35' exposed, 
of stratified bright green clay + 
white to greenish tuff.  The dips are 
very irregular. Intercalated in the 
series is a band, 
2"-4" thick, of white rock, very low 
sig.
