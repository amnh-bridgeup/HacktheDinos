NOTES ON PRECEDING 
			PROFILES 
 
  At this point there is an embay- 
ment in the west side of the lava- 
capped meseta of the Cerro del Humo. 
The sides of the embayment are formed 
by the barrancas, often obscured by 
slides, and the central part contains 
numerous more or less isolated hills 
and small mesetas, all of Tertiary 
tuff.  The general dip is eastward at 
a low angle, but the beds are much 
disturbed, partly by original tectonic 
movements, partly by slumping, 
observable, seldom equalling 5ยบ. 
  Directly W., between the embayment 
and the road to Laguna de los Palacios,
and continuing northward is a zone in
which the beds are more sharply tilted,
with an eastward dip of 50ยบ-30ยบ, and 
where the K-E transition is exposed.  
This, too, is affected by slumping + 
is also somewhat faulted, but is 
rather surely a fold of tectonic 
origin. 
  CHUBUTIANO-PEHUENCHE:  It is 
probable that all the beds shown in 
profile AA below the variegated 
silicified tuff (doubtless+ Argiles 
fissilaires) are Pehuenche. 
The apposition of a greenish sandstone 
and a dark, overlying clay suggest

"Upper quarries", profile p. 85. ? 
The level of the "lower quarries" is 
well defined, as marked.  That of the 
"upper quarries" is doubtful due to 
the nature of the exposures.  
I believe they lie in the upper part 
of the hard tuffs of this profile, 
about 20'-25' above the "lower 
quarries."  They are certainly 
not over 30' above the latter, + they 
are certainly not below them.  G.G.S.
