42  Remarks- Profile M.

1.  This thick, irregular channel 
series rapidly
grades laterally into 
more normal pinkish tuffs
like those 
above and below.  The plane of un-
conformity becomes less undulant but 
remains
visible, and the channel 
series reappears
farther east.  It 
is at a higher level than
the large 
channel series of profile A, but may
be contemporaneous.  The beds cannot 
be
traced, as they are eroded between 
the
two localities.
2.  A varying thickness of the upper 
part
of the pink tuffs is slightly 
indurated below the
unconformity + 
tends to stand in vertical cliffs.
3.  The lower 15Õ± of the pink tuffs
immediately west of here is somewhat 
indurated.
It contains much manganese 
+ calcite, barite, +
chalcedony 
concretions.  A zone 10Õ Ð 15Õ above 
the
base contains innumerable bones, 
but extremely
fragmentary except a few
in concretionary manganese
(#242 etc.).  Immediately east of 
here this
level passes into an 
irregular channel series up
to 25'± thick + unconformable at the 
base.  It
appears to be 
contemporaneous with Bed X
of Profile I or the 'Lower Channel' 
of profile
A.
	The bed marked Y has been 
traced
continuously through all the 
profiles and is the
most certain and 
easily recognizable in the
barranca, 
although the tuff is here thinner +
less pure or white than at most 
localities
farther west.
