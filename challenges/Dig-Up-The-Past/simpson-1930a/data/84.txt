140  At about the point where the ?is, 
and somewhat outside the line of 
section, there is an isolated 
stream-bank exposure of bright green 
clay, closely similar to the 
"bird clay" and containing 
small bone fragments, resting on 
white sandstone, the bas of which is 
not visible. 
 
  ?.  The "pillar bed" [below] is over- 
lain by clays, generally gray to pale 
greenish, and fine to very coarse 
white, gray, or yellowish x-bedded to 
massive sands.  In this series, about 
20' above the pillar bed, is a lens of 
coarse sandstone, distinctly 
cross-bedded and of thickness up to 
about 2', in which occur many 
fragmentary and dissociated 
mammal bones, jaws, teeth, etc.  
#445, 446, 
450.  The bed is generally hard, 
topping 
small hummocks, and weathers either in 
slaty fragments or in coarse blocks, 
often with honeycombed surfaces + 
frequently reddish 
where weathered.  R78, 79. 
  This is part of a thick series of 
clays and sandstones totally unlike 
the usual "Eocene tuffs" and 
resembling 
the usual Pehuenche sediments. 
A continuous section cannot be taken 
+ the beds, from their lenticular
