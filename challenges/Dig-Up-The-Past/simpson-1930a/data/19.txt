24  Notes on Profiles, p. 22.
Profile A copied from pp. 4-6, half
scale.
Profile G is of these same beds, the
middle series, about _ km. or a little 
more
from where A was taken, on the 
east side
of the spur.  Here a thick 
channel series
runs from the 'upper 
tuff' through the
'upper channel' of A.
It contains many
local unconformities,
 but no outstanding
break or traceable 
divisions.  The fossils in it are 
almost exclusively large astrapo-
theres.  The level of #69 is a heavy
conglomerate at the line of profile, 
with very numerous but mostly very 
fragmentary fossils.
This thick channel series grades
rapidly laterally into more normal 
tuffs
and at Profile H, less 
than _ km. away East
is hardly recognizable as such, 
although
there are still probably 
some coarse beds.
Here is a thick 
lava flow, as shown, +
a thin channel 
bed some distance above it.
