  In Lote 18, to the north of here, 
is exposed the upper part of the 
Pehuenche, red ss. + pale clays as 
elsewhere. No arg. fis.  Above this 
pinkish to white tuffs, with a few 
fossils (#415). Above these a series of 
thin bedded very fissile clays, sandy 
clays, + fine sands, yellow in general 
tone, a type of sediment not so far 
seen elsewhere.  The bedding on the 
whole is very regular and horizontal 
and such irregularities as exist seem 
due to compression.  Apparently a lake 
series. We split many pieces but found
no organic traces.
