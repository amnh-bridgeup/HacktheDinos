C.  Term "Argiles fissilaires"- 
 
  1.  Was not proposed as a formation 
name.  [Form. Séd., p. 103, 
"Ces argiles 
fissilaires ne constituent 
pas un horizon déterminé, 
car il yena dans le 
pyrotheréen, dans le noto- 
stylopéen, dans le 
salamanquéen, dans le péhuen- 
chéen, et aussi dans 
les grés bigarrés."] 
  2.  Is a descriptive 
term ( and in a 
language foreign to the 
country in which the 
beds occur and to its author). 
  3.  Is incorrectly 
descriptive, since the 
type of rock referred 
to is neither clay nor, 
in the exact sense of 
the term, fissile. 
  The current use (by 
whom started?) for 
a definite stratigraphic 
unit between the 
Pehuenche and the 
Notostylopense is therefore 
undesirable. 
  The "argiles fissilaies" may be: 
  1.  A stratigraphic and 
temporal unit unrep- 
resented by any other 
type of rock, in which 
case it may be considered as 
a.	A member of the 
	Pehuenche Formation. 
b.	A member of the 
	Casamayor       " 
c.	An independent, 
	intermediate formation 
for which the name Mazaredo 
Formation would 
be most appropriate. 
  2.  A lithologic phase of 
the same age 
as rocks of different 
type elsewhere now 
placed in other formations, 
in which case it 
may be considered as or 
proven to be 
a.  Equivalent to part of the 
Pehuenche of 
other localities, hence either 
?.  To be placed in the 
Pehuenche as 
a local lithologic member, or 
?.  To be separated from the 
Pehuenche 
 with that part of the latter 
equivalent to it. 
b.  Equivalent to part of 
the Notostylops 
beds of other localities + 
hence to enter into the 
Casamayor formation. 
 
 
			D. 
  Supposed association of 
dinosaurs + 
mammals. 
  Probably due to these causes: 
  1.  Faulty correlation 
of beds at different 
localities, due largely 
to failure to take 
structure into account. 
  2.  Broad use of the 
term "Notostylopense" 
so as to include in the 
one "Formation" beds 
with dinosaurs + beds with 
mammals, although 
they are not in the same bed. 
  3.  Discovery of mammals 
on or even 
in the surface of dinosaur 
bearing beds, 
+ failure to recognize 
that they were not in 
place. 
  4.  Identification of 
crocodile teeth, mammalian 
laniaries, + perhaps some 
bone fragments as 
dinosaurs. 
  [5.  Finding of dinosaur 
bones washed or 
brought from elsewhere on 
mammal bearing 
beds.] 
  Have seen excellent 
examples of first 
four.  5 is improbable + 
was not seen.
