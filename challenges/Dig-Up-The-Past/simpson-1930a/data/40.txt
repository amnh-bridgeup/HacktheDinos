60  There are true folds in this 
region,the only ones seen in the long 
barranca sections where slumping has 
surely not occurred, + similar whether
the beds be composed of Tertiary, arg.
fis., undoubted Cretaceous (to 
Pehuenche) or any combination of these.
These are the very broad folds with 
clips of a few degrees, generally 
clearly perceptible only where
the beds can be followed for a 
kilometer or more ? the "tipo de 
plegamiento que caracteriza al cumplexo
Terciario" of Windhausen.  Without
prejudice to the possibility of 
numerous parallel unconformities here 
or of angular unconformities elsewhere,
this is the only folding of which 
there is any evidence in the region so
far studied (Nov. 28, 1930).
It is subsequent to the Pyrotherium + 
probably also to the Colpodon beds.
	We found no fossils in the 
argiles fissilaires, + there appears 
to be no record of any ever being
found in place there.

	NOTOSTYLOPENSE: The lowest 
fossils in place were found about 25' 
above the argiles fissilaires(Profile,
 p. 46), the highest in the same
section surely notostylopean about 130'
 135' above
this.  Fossils apparently of the 
Notostylopense were found at numerous 
levels through about 150' of beds.  It
is not yet apparent whether there
is any faunal difference in this 
rather thick series.  Nothing in it 
checks at all with Ameghino's
Upper Notostylops stratigraphically.
	Once found, the fossiliferous 
beds are easily found at any point 
along the whole barranca by a key 
horizon which we have traced 
continuously from end to
end + which can always be recognized.
