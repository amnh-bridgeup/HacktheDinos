 128  - it floats!- probably 
diatomaceous earth. 
(Rock specimens: 60, 61).  Laterally 
at this level but not in stratigraphic
continuity, outside line of section, 
are sandy clays with pebbles 
(Rocks: 62-64). 
 
  F. ? A series of green clays with 
small pebbles + spots, looking like 
porphyry (Rock 56  ), with lenses of 
coarse sandstone + gravel like that 
of the Pehuenche.  A few scraps of 
mammal bones found on the clays.  
Bedding not visible. 
 
 
  The lack of continuous exposures, 
the frequent absence of visible 
bedding, the highly irregular dips 
where determinable, and the probable 
presence of faults, make the 
determination of 
a true sequence impossible.
