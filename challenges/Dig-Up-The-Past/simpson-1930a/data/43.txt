  Excursion with Dr. Feruglio to
Peñalba, on the upper Rio Chico.
  On the cliff on E. side of the
laguna the base of the Salamanqueano,
with its cg. of transgression, 
and the top of the Chubutiano are 
visible.
  Along the Chico the generalized 
section is as follows:

		PEHUENCHE
Banco Negro
		SALAMANQUEANO, with
Banco Verde  Ost. pyrotheriorum, etc.

			Lava Flow

DIKE		       CHUBUTIANO
		       with dinosaurs.

  Here also Feruglio states that 
dinosaurs have been found only in the 
Chubutiano + not in the Pehuenche to 
his knowledge. He says none of the 
discoveries of dinosaurs in the 
Pehuenche are authenticated.  The
following structural conditions near 
Peñalba account for the former belief 
that dinosaurs between there + 
Williams(?) were from the
Pehuenche: (p. 68.)

*  But there are other points in the 
neighborhood known locally as Cerro 
Blanco.  The name is also applied
to the barranca S. of Coli-Huapi 
descriptively.
