	          Profiles. 
  The position of these sections 
corresponds more or less to Ameghino's
profile (Form. Sed., p. 83)  "Rive 
Gauche du > 
dans le tiers supérieur de son cours." 
In p. 98 the red ss. etc. at the base 
is probably Ameghino's #11, red ss. 
without fossils, referred by him to 
Salamanqueano.  It is doubtless 
Pehuenche as now understood. 
The grey shale is probably his 9 + 10, 
greenish clays with siliceous 
concretions, Notostylops fauna, + 
dinosaurs; and dark clays with the 
Notostylops fauna.  I went over a 
considerable part of this and saw no 
trace of dinosaurs.  In some places 
(the Notostylops beds just above being 
here unusually rich) there are mammal 
bones on the surface and even imbedded
in the clay- but only in the top inch 
or two which is cracked and is highly 
plastic when wet ? none in the hard 
shale in situ.  I do not believe that 
the Notostylops fauna is present in 
these beds, which Should probably also
be placed in the Pehuenche. 
  Argiles fissilaires are totally 
absent as such. 
  The rest of section BC probably 
corresponds to Ameghino's 7 + 8 + is 
true Notostylopense. 
  Except for the rodados tehuelches, 
his #1, the higher members of 
Ameghino's section are not 
recognizable + probably were 
observed only at other localities 
with a more complete Tertiary series.
