  The Tertiary exposures lie 
in the broad basin of the upper 
part of a cañadón which empties 
into the Rio Chico immediately above 
Paso Niemann, on the right (SE) 
bank of the river, nearly opposite 
the mouth of Cañadón Vaca. 
  This cañadón is (crossed out: 
locally called 
Cañadón Tres Botellas, but is) 
known to the Y.P.F. geologists 
as Cañadón Hondo.
