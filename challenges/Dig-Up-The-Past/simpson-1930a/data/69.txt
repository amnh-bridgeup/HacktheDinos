114  slumping or faulting.  The choice 
between these two is not important 
stratigraphically (although very 
important economically + structurally)
but the evidence is briefly as follows: 
  For faulting: 
1.  This is a large topographic 
feature not on the scale of most 
slumps. 
2.  The down thrown beds remain for 
the most part horizontal and without 
marked dislocation within themselves 
along a long front. 
3.  Minor faults parallel (roughly) 
to this and with a throw of up to 50' 
are seen. (But they could, less 
probably, be due to slumping).  The 
throw along the main fault zone would 
have to be 150', more or less. 
4.  The uniformity of the phenomenon +
coherence of the rather incompetent 
tuffs speaks against slumping. 
5.  The base of the downthrust part 
rests normally on the clays with no 
slumping surface or zone visible. 
 For slumping: 
1.  The thick plastic clays beneaththe 
tuffs form ideal conditions for 
slumping. 
2.  Slumping has clearly occurred at 
numerous points along the outer margin
of the downthrust block (but on a much
smaller scale and 
with obvious disarrangement of the 
beds). 
3.  The movement is related to the 
present topography as in a slump, 
(but if a fault it must have occurred
 within the present erosion cycle and 
the valley edge may have been defined 
by it) and ranging (?) parallel to 
the valley wall beyond this area.
