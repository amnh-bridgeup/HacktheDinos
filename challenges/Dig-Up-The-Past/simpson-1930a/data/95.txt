I.  FACIES AND FORMATIONS. 
On Cabeza Blanca there 
are six chief facies 
or formations, viz.: 
1.  Rodados, in places forming 
thin lenses, water 
deposited, on the flat top of 
the peak. 
2.  Marine tuffs, yellowish, 
massive, overlying 
a relatively thin, lenticular 
marine basal ss. 
or cg.  90'±. 
3.  Fine sands, generally 
soft and grey to 
yellowish.  Thin-bedded.  
X-bedded on a small 
scale.  In the upper part 
with lenses of harder 
+ often coarser ss., or cg.  
Fine sands often 
ripple marked.  Stream or 
small delta deposit. 
0-40'±. 
4.  Greenish-grey channel beds, 
very irregular, 
often x-bedded.  Ranging from 
tuff to sand to 
fine cg.  Materials apparently 
generally pyro- 
clastic, appearance even of 
sands unlike that 
of 3.  0-75'± 
5.  Thickly + generally rather 
vaguely bedded 
non-channel tuffs, probably 
both wind- and water- 
deposited.  Generally yellowish 
on weathered 
surfaces at least.  Bedding 
apparently broadly 
oblique to the basal 
contact.  0-90'± 
6.  Massive pale-colored 
tuffs, generally 
buff to pinkish, but also 
grey + yellowish. 
Bedding usually very vague 
or invisible.  Many 
small concretions, esp. 
in upper part.  At least 
50' + probably much more, 
base not exposed  
here.
