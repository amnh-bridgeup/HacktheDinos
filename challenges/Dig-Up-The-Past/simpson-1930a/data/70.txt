  -But the difference is only between 
a deeper phenomenon influencing the 
underlying beds also and a more 
shallow, influencing the tuffs only. 
  In either case the result is the 
same so far as the actual exposures 
are concerned.  It must be inferred 
that the beds of the other slope have 
moved down relative to those of the 
inner.  Hence the total thickness from
the contact with the clay to the top 
of the tuff series here present was 
less than the actual elevation between
 the clay contact (at the base of 
the outer slope) + the rodado contact 
(at the top of the inner), nearly 400'  
Some beds must be repeated in the two 
slopes at different elevations.  There 
is no geologic evidence for this as 
the exposures of the inner, pampa, 
slope are so poor.  Even fossils from 
the inner slope would not solve the 
question perhaps as the Notostylopense
is here so thick and without faunal 
differences over great thicknesses 
so far as seen in the field. 
  This phenomenon and also the lesser 
faults and the true obvious slumping 
along the tuff-clay contact have been 
taken into consideration and the 
sections and fossil records are of 
continuous slopes without 
repetition or omission of beds.
