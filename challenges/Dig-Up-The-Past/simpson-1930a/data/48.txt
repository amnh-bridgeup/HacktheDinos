  The upper ledge of hard vesicular 
tuff as colpodon-age fossils extent 
only into the upper part of this, and 
the large parastrapo-there occurs in 
its lower part definitely above the 
lava flows.  This vesicular tuff
contains local unconformities at 
more than one level, and in places 
original oblique bedding makes at least
local disconformity self-evident.  
This probably defines the boundary 
between Colpodonen + Pyrot., although 
taking the barranca as a whole one 
would have no reason aside from
the fossils to consider this as more 
important than other levels of local 
unconformity.

  Colpodonense: Colpodon age fossils 
begin to appear in the upper part of 
the cornice series of hard vesicular 
tuffs etc. and extend in considerable 
abundance through a maximum thickness 
of about 70'.  Above the fossiliferous
part and conformable unit is a maximum
of about 150' of tuffs which contain 
only a few bone fragments + in which 
we found no identifiable specimens.

Dec. 3-6, 1930-
EXCURSION UP THE R√çO SENGUER

  At the Vuelta del Senguer there is 
only Chubutiano, according to recent 
work by Cabrera + Y.P.F. geologists 
and contrary to Windhausen + V. Huene 
(pers. com.) who state that there is 
Triassic.  The Sierra San Bernardo
ends on the n. side of the river here,
but its folds, completely peneplaned, 
continue under the flat level of the 
Valle Hermoso on the S. side.
  From here due to a bad road + 
reported absence of mammal beds we 
made a long detour over pampas without 
exposures and rejoined the river at La
Confluencia.  We then followed the west
bank of the river as far as the 
settlement of the Ensanche de la 
Colonia Sarmiento, where we crossed 
the river and followed the east bank 
down for about 3 leagues, then returned
to the direct Ensanche-Sarmiento road 
and went back to Sarmiento.
  The beds encountered would not repay
museum work and we therefore did not 
spend the time necessary to take 
detailed profiles. The general 
conditions, from our rapid survey, 
appear to be as follows:
  On the south side of the Rio Mayo
Valdez at the Confluencia the marine 
upper Patagoniano is exposed.  
Following the west bank northward, one
first crosses a lava flow which appears
 to lie beneath
