II.  CONTACTS 
 
1-2.  Clearly discordant.  
A much later thin 
stream deposit on a marine series. 
2-3.  A marked and rather abrupt 
lithologic 
change, but probably due 
rather to sudden 
change of conditions rather 
than to lapse of 
any considerable time.  
In the upper part 
of 3 appear coarser lenses 
which become 
more numerous until the 
fine ss. forms lenses in 
the coarser, and the uppermost 
coarse beds are 
frankly marine + basal to the 
overlying tuffs. 
3-4.	This contact is 
nearly plane but 
sharp.  With the highly 
lenticular nature of 
3, a disconformity is indicated. 
3-5.  In places 3 overlaps 
4 and has a 
similar contact with 5.  
In general, however, 
3 is thickest over 4 + appears 
to overlap 
5 only slightly. 
2-5.  Where 3 has wedged out, 
2 contacts 
with 5 (apparently also in 
places similarly 4, but 
not so clear).  The contact 
is certainly discon- 
formable, very sharp, 
generally with a basal 
marine conglomerate of 
transgression. 
4-5.  This contact (shown 
in the middle of 
the hill in the section 
but elsewhere exposed on 
the surface) seems to be 
that typical between 
channel beds and nearly or 
quite contemporaneous 
flood-plain beds, i.e. the 
channel beds in part 
incised + in part grading 
into the others.

4,5-6.  Although the lithographic 
difference 
between 5 + 6 is slight, 
the contact is discordant 
apparently, as is that 
between 4 + 6.  The 
thickness of 4 + 5 (together) 
varies much, 6 at 
times almost reaching 2 or 3, 
and the bedding 
of 4 + 5 is not always 
parallel to the contact. 
The contact is irregular.  
The base of both 
4 + 5 is coarse, approaching 
sandy texture, 
or even gravel.  
There appears definitely to 
be a break in the series, 
its value, of course, only 
determinable from fossils 
or regional study. 
	III.  FOSSILS AND AGES. 
  1.  This is a terrace 
gravel resting 
on the flat upper surface, 
a remnant of 
an erosion plain.  It is 
lower than the 
original rodado deposit, 
the Tehuelche of 
the high pampa, but far 
above the present 
river level, hence probably 
Pleistocene. 
  2.  The marine beds 
contain a large in- 
vertebrate fauna.  A penguin 
bone found on 
the surface of the lower 
beds perhaps came 
from here, perhaps from 
the lower beds.  In 
the slope of the high pampa 
nearby, whale 
bones occur.  This bed is part of the 
Patagoniano. 
  2-3.  The transitional 
cg. + ss. lenses in 
the base of 2 + top of 3 
contain very 
numerous bits of bones 
and teeth.  These are
