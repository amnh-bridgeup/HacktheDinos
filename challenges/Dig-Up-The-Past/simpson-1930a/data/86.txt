  They are rarely twinned, almost 
always single, and occur over a 
large area irregularly distributed 
but with an average density of 
about 5 or 6 per 100 sq. ft. (10 
ft. square). 
  Exactly perpendicular to the true 
bedding.  Where this is tilted, so are 
they. 
  Always slightly and often very much 
harder than the surronding rock. 
  Their material, sand, may be of 
about the same fineness as their matrix, 
but may also be somewhat coarser, 
with inclusions of small pebbles and 
possibly bone frags. (see sample, R).  
The sand in them shows no true bedding,
but may have a vague zoning 
horizontally or nearly so of somewhat 
coarser and finer material, not 
corresponding to any structure 
in the matrix. 
  Their apices are often more or 
less conical when little weathered. 
  Like most of the harder ss. of 
the area, but unlike the matrix, 
weathering 
often turns the surface reddish. 
  Below the conical apex they 
show some horizontal fluting, but
