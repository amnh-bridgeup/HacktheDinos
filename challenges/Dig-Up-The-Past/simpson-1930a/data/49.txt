78  the Patagoniano and, like the 
latter, to dip with a southward 
component.  After an obscure space one 
comes to beds presumably lower, from 
the nature of the dip, consisting of 
silicified tuffs in part variegated
+ concretionary.  Although not exactly 
similar to those of Coli-Huapi, with 
more white beds; these are probably the
argiles fissilaires.  Somewhat farther
north comes the crest of what is 
apparently a very broad anticline + 
here beneath the arg. fis.-like series 
there is an upper thick series chiefly 
x-bedded sands + gravels and a lower 
series of tuffs similar to those of 
the Tertiary.  We examined all these 
carefully and found no scrap of bone 
or tooth.  Continuing north come 
successively higher beds until one
finds small exposures of Tertiary 
tuffs definitely resting on argiles 
fissilaires.  Here we found
scraps of bone and fragments of mammal
teeth, but nothing identifiable.  The 
exposures are small + poor and they 
contain very few fossils and would not
repay intensive work from
the paleontological point of view.  
Near the Ensanche appears a lava flow, 
its relationships not clear from our 
hasty survey but apparently either on 
or in the Tertiary, +this eventually 
dips down northward into the valley,
beyond which point there are no good
exposures at least to the settlement.
  On the other side one also sees
a thick somewhat folded + dislocated
series of argiles fissilaires and 
resting on it some white beds.  
The latter were seen only from a 
distance as


the exposure is too small to be of  79
much use and apparently identical 
with the almost barren beds seen 
directly across the river, + would 
have required one or two days
more to visit and inspect.
  The road through the Sierra to 
Sarmiento has been studied by Feruglio,
who has published a profile.  The 
rocks are all Chubutiano.


  WORKING CAMP #2
Dec. 7, 1930-Dec. 15, 1930.
  About 10 leagues due north of 
Sarmiento,just east of the road from 
Sarmiento to the Laguna de los 
Palacios.  A large shallow embayment 
against the lava-capped meseta of the 
Cerro del Humo and directly east 
across the valley from the Sierra de 
Castillo.
  Here a high barranca forms a large
curve and the space in front of it
is full of broken country, small 
mesetas, etc., with other Tertiary 
exposures.
 Locality indicated to us by Feruglio,
who mentions it in his work.
  Ameghino's maps show a locality 
immediately north of the western end 
of Coli-Huapi, with Notostylopense and 
Pyrotheriense, and another northwest 
of this with Notostylopense
and Astraponotense.
