146  are generally nearly cylindrical. 
  The weathered bases are often 
somewhat undercut + smaller than 
the column as a whole, but where 
unweathered generally expand some- 
what like the base of a tree, but 
were not observed to pass out into 
root-like projections. 
  In places the bases were observed 
to pass into a fairly continuous hard 
layer of ss. 
  In some, but apparently not in all, 
cases the apex reaches and blends 
with a hard capping.  The bed in 
which they occur generally has such 
a capping, even beyond the area in 
which the pillars occur. 
  Weathering does not produce them, 
but only releases them from the matrix. 
  The apices and often the columns 
as well are commonly traversed by 
very steeply inclined fissures with 
the surface somewhatlike slickensides, 
but along which very little motion can 
have taken place. 
  In one or two places irregular 
low wall-like projections weather 
out similarly like very irregular 
dikes.
