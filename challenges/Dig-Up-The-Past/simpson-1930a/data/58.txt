CAÑADON VACA		97 
CAMP 3 
Dec. 18, 1930 ? Feb. 9, 1931 
 
  Camp slightly over a league 
(by road) north of Cerro Salpú at a 
manantial in a small zanjón leading 
into Cañadón Vaca. 
  The beds worked from this camp 
are almost straight across Cañadón 
Vaca, white badlands visible from the 
hill above the manantial.  They are 
on the southern slope of the Pampa 
Pelada, half a league more and less 
east of the road which crosses the 
cañadon and ascends to the pampa 
Pelada where it leads on the one 
hand to Sierra Chaira, on the other to 
Paso Nicmann ( + Comodoro). 
    General region indicated to us by 
Feruglio, + part of the large area 
along + near the Chico shown on 
Ameghino's Notostylopense map.  It is 
also shown on Windhausen's geologic 
map, which is very erroneous in detail 
however, as he shows "Eocene" below 
Cretaceous on the south side of the 
Cañadón, requiring a complex + non- 
existent structure. 
  Except for those near the Puesto Van 
Wyk, the beds worked from here are in 
Lote 3, Fracción D, Sección D1.
