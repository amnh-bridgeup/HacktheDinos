92  At most places, the lower 
part of the Pyrotherium beds contain 
hard tuffs, weathering brown, + 
vesicular, although these are 
occasionally lacking. In profile AA 
the Pyrotherium jaw (although its 
horizon is not fixed within 15') 
defines the base of the beds at or 
near a similar hard brown bed and 
there are numerous bones + frag. teeth 
in the base of the formation.  In 
AB no fossils were found but the 
presence of an unconformity and of 
beds similar lithologically places 
the equivalence as indicated, beyond 
much doubt. 
  In all three sections a pale buff 
to pink tuff with hard silicified 
patches or concretions occurs about 
100'-125' above the base of the 
Pyrotherium beds, without any apparent
intervening break. It is highly 
probable that this distinctive 
bed is the same in the three cases.  
In AA it contains rare Strophocheilus 
and a few identifiable mammals.  In 
AB it  was found barren.  In AC it 
contains abundant Strophocheilus and 
some bone fragments, but no 
identifiable mammals were found. 
  In section AC a still higher series 
is exposed, as shown, but no 
identifiable fossils were found.

AGE OF FOLDING: 
  The presence of a fold here with 
dips relatively high for the Tertiary 
(up to 30ยบ) seems very important.  
Even though somewhat obscured by 
slumping and small faults, this fold 
(monoclinal in the part observed but 
perhaps one limb of an anticline the 
other limb of which is buried in the 
valley) seems to be antecedent to the 
present topography, unlike the 
supposed fields in the arg. fis. south
of Coli-Huapi.  With almost constant 
strike and no unusual or sudden 
changes in dip it follows for some 
distance.  Its axis is roughly 
parallel to that o the anticlines of 
Cerro Chenque, Cerro Castillo, etc., 
and it lies almost in line with the 
former. It seems possible that it is 
part of the same system of folds, 
often supposed to be pre- or 
eo-Tertiary. 
  Here, at least, there appears to 
have been no marked folding before 
the Pyrotheriano.  There is no 
evidence of any folding to the top of 
the Notostylopense.  The beds are 
sensibly parallel + folding, if 
present, was too slight to be 
observed in small sections. 
There is some, but uncertain, evidence
