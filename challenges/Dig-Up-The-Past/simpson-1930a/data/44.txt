PEHUENCHE
  Banco Negro		Variegated
    Banco Verde	        ?Sandstone 
			with
      obscure 		dinosaurs 

Former interpretation:

PEHUENCHE		Pehuenche 
			with
			dinosaurs.
SALAMANQUEANO

Present + certainly correct 
interpretation:
			SALAMANQ.
PEHUENCHE		CHUBUTIANO WITH
SALAMANQ.		dinosaurs.
CHUBUT.


		FAULT
  This is proven by the discovery of
Salamanqueano with fossils above the
dinosaur beds in a continuous section.
The Chubutiano + Pehuenche are very
similar + cannot be surely 
distinguished except by relations 
with other beds.
