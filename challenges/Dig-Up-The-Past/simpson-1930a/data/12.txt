14  Remarks, Profile D, p.12.
  Following the deposition of the 
intermediate
tuffs (beds on lower part 
p. 4 + top p.6) was
a period of 
erosion.  The lower contact of the
lava is broadly uneven and obviously 
dis-
cordant in places, cutting across 
the bedding.
Where the lava does not 
occur the level
of this surface is 
usually marked by a
lithologic change, 
but where observed is nearly
horizontal
and appears concordant.
  Between the lava and the upper 
channel
beds, which sometimes but not 
invariably reach
the lava, are barren 
green clays (probably in
part from 
decomposition of the lava) and sandy
clays.  Then follows the upper channel 
series,
resting on an eroded surface.
  The lavas represent surface flows, 
and
apparently were subjected to 
considerable
decomposition and then 
erosion before the
deposition of the 
upper channel beds.
