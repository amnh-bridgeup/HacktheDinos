  ? - This thick series of green clay 
and mingled clay, sand, + gravel, 
while not traced laterally exactly, 
clearly grades into and corresponds
with part, and apparently the lower 
part, of the green beds of Section CF. 
The dip in this barranca exposure 
is variable but where the section 
was taken averages about 10° WSW, 
sufficient to carry the lowest exposed 
bed over the highest exposure of 
the sands of Pehuenche type if con- 
tinued.  It is clear from a study of 
the whole area that these green 
beds lie largely or wholly above the 
Pehuenche-type sediments.  The actual 
contact relations cannot be made out, 
it remains an open question whether 
they are unconformable, or intergrade 
vertically, or whether the basal part 
of the green series grades laterally 
into the top of the Pehuenche-type 
rocks. 
 
  ?.  The structure of this zone is 
complex and confusing, discontinuous 
exposures, folding, faulting, 
slumping. No definite guide horizon 
could be found.
