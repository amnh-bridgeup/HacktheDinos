  Excursion with Dr. Feruglio to Cerro
Cresta (local name) or Cerro Abigarrado
(name given by Cabrera) or 
Cerro Colorado de Purichelli 
(Feruglio).  N. end of Pampa Mar√≠a 
Ssma.
  Here the section from upper 
Chubutiano
to top of Pehuenche or base of Argiles 
fissilaires is well exposed, but there 
is no Tertiary.

  The Pehuenche and Chubutiano are
closely similar but the Pehuenche has
the characteristic "black banks" and 
no dinosaurs have been found in it, 
while here the Chubutiano is coarser 
in ????, rather less vivid in coloring,
 + has numerous dinosaur bones.  They 
are separated by the marine and 
estuarine Salamanqueano, of 
characteristic green color.
