3.	Upper Notostylopense 
       (the pink parts)
And also Astraponotense 
(the channel gravels).
  In the latter case Ameghino's Upper
Notostylopense + Astraponolense of 
Coli-Huapi are the same, which seems 
quite possible in the field, as 
nothing below checks even re-
motely with his data for the U.Notos.+
nothing above checks well with his 
data for Astraponotense.
  Between this and the next gravels 
we have only one specimen, #94.

  Lava + Upper Channels:  Regarding the
channel beds, it is necessary to 
distinguish between the hard tuffs 
weathering yellow to orange with 
vessicles, + true conglomerates.  The 
hard beds are usually but not 
invariable associated with or part of 
a true channel series.  On the other 
hand channel gravels may also occur 
(as lower half of p. 4) without 
associated hard beds.  Gravels appear
from 30' to 100' above that of the 
so-called lower channel.  Where most 
powerfully developed(west end of 
barranca, e.g. prof. p. 6, p. 22) they
have a thickness of over 100', with 
recurrent conglomerates + numerous 
local unconformities, overlain by the 
hard orange beds which also contain 
some gravel.  These are of course
highly variable and grade laterally 
into tuffs with few or no true gravel 
beds and no visible unconformities, 
although usually one or two pebble 
horizons remain.

  There are large lava flows at each 
end of the barranca and various small 
tongues seen in section near the west 
end.  Contrary to my first belief, 
these are not at exactly the same 
level.  They rest in small valleys
on the eroded surface of the underlying
beds and the slight differences of 
level may be due purely to that fact.  
Their presence does not necessarily 
indicate an important unconformity
as similar erosion surfaces are 
indicated equally clearly 
(or obscurely) at various other
levels in this channel series.  
Whether or not these are the result of
one eruption, there were lava flows in 
this region previously for in one or 
two spots pebbles of vesicular lava 
were found in place in cg. at least
30' below the surface on which a local
flow rests.  Except for these, which 
are nowhere numerous, the gravels are 
all of materials which could be derived
from the beds below them, chiefly hard 
tuff pebbles.
  It seems reasonable to conclude that 
in this area there was a fairly 
prolonged period of extrusion of lavas
and that it coincided with the channel 
deposit in general.  The only fossils 
found in this part of the series were 
fairly numerous fragmentary remains of 
a very large Parastrapothere and
a few fragments of Pyrotherium, 
although none of the latter found by 
us happen to have been in place.  The 
top of the lava flows is not 
coincident with the Pyrotheriense-
Colpodonense boundary.  The location 
of This cannot be fixed within a few 
feet At any one locality, but occurs 
within
