Usually indurated, commonly harder than the channel sands and developing
as rim rocks topographically. In places these rims are so prominent
and seemingly continuous that they seem to provide the wanted guide
horizons, but when traced laterally with care for a few miles they are
found to change stratigraphic level and not to be the same bed over a
large area. Thickness is highly variable but is commonly 30'-40'.

The CHANNEL SS is markedly and visibly lenticular in one plane, from a
few yards to perhaps 1/4 mile in width, and elongate in the other
direction. The thickness in the middle of the lens is from a few inches
up to 20'-25' - these greater thicknesses never in a single bed but a
complex series of irregular lenses, often interspersed with irregular
clays, more visibly irregular and lenticular than the normal (floodplain)
banded clays.

These channel ss's are usually white, often mottled yellow, generally
much paler on weathered surfaces than the flood ss. They contain some
gravel but tend to be fine grained. Mostly they are poorly indurated,
softer and weathering more easily than the flood ss. Many of the beds
of very fine white ss are soft in general but with considerable
concretionary cementing, weathering out in rounded masses up to several
feet in diameter. The somewhat coarser beds are commonly platy and 
highly X-bedded.

Some of the larger channels contain more massive, harder, darker brown,
X-bedded, rather coarse ss, closely similar to the flood ss's, with which
they intergrade.
