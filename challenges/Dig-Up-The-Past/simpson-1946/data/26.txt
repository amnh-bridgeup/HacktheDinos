NOTES ON MOSAIC SHEETS
NEW MEXICO

8 - SE part traversed 23 Aug, as marked. Tw ss exposures in SE
corner, not promising. Most of quad. probably Tw, but no likely
prospecting areas noted. Just Sof Dulce, road descends scarp onto
K.

9 - Not examined in '46.

10 - "	"	"

11 - Traversed on (Farmington) - Aztec - Cedar Hill - (Durango)
road, also Aztec - (Bloomfield). Torrejon localities NW of Animas
R. betw. Aztec & Cedar Hill and S of Aztec (on Bloomfield road) - 
See Granger. Not yet worked by me.

12 - Traversed (as 11) only along Animas. Quad. spans from Torrejon
well down into K. May have some good Torrejon exposures on La Plata
or Farmington glade - to be checked.



20 - Route not marked on sheet, but 23 Aug 46 we entered this sheet
N middle, S past Boulder Lake to Stinking (Burford) Lake, then E
(very bad road) to EL Vado Reservoir and off NE. Traverse is 
entirely on Cretaceous. Scarp along W side of quad, above lakes,
is capped by presumed basal "Wasatch" ss. & should have Paleocene
below, but is overgrown everywhere seen. No T exposures known in
quad. Except
