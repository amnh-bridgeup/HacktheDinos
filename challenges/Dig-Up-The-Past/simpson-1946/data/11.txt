NOTES ON PARTICULAR LOCALITIES:

17 - Relatively rich small rincon in SE 1/4 of Sec.31, T23N, R1W. Merits brief re-examination when horseshoe is worked.

18 - Clay bed, weathering yellowish, steep exposures here near or at bottom of slope. Jaws too scattered to permit quarrying, but this is the richest surface locality found, having yielded in '46 13 jaws (2 assoc. teeth or more) along exposure of perhaps 1/8 mile. Merits re-inspection yearly, or as convenient. Exact locality is shown in photos.

30 - Larger but also fairly rich locality, around base of isolated hill. (Old trail passes right by NW side of hill, between it and the main NW rim, on SW branch of Red Lake ["Almagre"] Arroyo, ca. 1/2 mile before reaching the divide.)

41, etc.  The small rincon, at but mainly just outside dicarilla reservation boundary, at low point in rim NW of the head of the Largo in SW 1/4 of Sec.7, T23N, R1W. Relatively a great deal of bone, although nothing very outstanding was found. Bone mostly in hard gray mottled clay, weathering yellow.

42. This is a typical channel ss. lens occurance, with many scraps of bone and some teeth and jaw fragments.

45-50. This area, relatively high in the beds worked, is unusually rich in scattered Coryphodon fragments. Some suggestion of association and an effort was made in several places to find assoc. material in situ, but nothing of value was developed.
