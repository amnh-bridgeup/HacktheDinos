58.  Small mammal quarry. See photos for exact location. About 12 days work by one man in '46. Overburden up to 2' and can be continued almost indefinitely without much more overburden. Area worked in '46 about 60 ft square.
Bones were in levels up to 2' apart from the horizontal, but bony part is not truly horizontal but irregular and at any one point bones were not over 1' vertically from each other. Even in fossil layer bones are not really common, mostly small fragments, and one good jaw in 4 to 5 square feet (about a day's work) is usual yield.

On the weathered surface this looks like a single bed, somewhat blotchy pale yellow clay, and seems to form a uniform horizontal band, but beneath the surface there appear to be at least 6 successive lenticular deposits in the 3' depth of the quarry, and none of these is uniformly horizontal. Contacts in general are blended and each bed seems to have been wet when the next was deposits.

Most of the bones are in a steely or slightly bluish to mauve gray clay, more or less profusely spotted yellow (ochraceous). This is somewhat splotched with and grades into purplish or pale burgundy clay, which contains few bones. The clay is extremely compact and tough when unweathered. It disintegrates quickly when alternately wet and dry, but marked weathering extends only ca. 1' from horizontal surface. Unweathered clay is slightly moist and contracts and checks when dried.

Bones are much scattered. No articulation observed, but some bunchin or grouping of bones.
