MAJOR AREAS REMAINING TO BE WORKED ALONG EASTERN EDGE OF BASIN:

1. Arroyo Blanco - Prob. Cope's first horseshoe. Very large area of excellent exposures, none worked in 146 except brief recon. Also includes some scattered exposures bet. SE part of Blanco basin and NE part of "Almagre" basin.

2. "The Rincon" SW of Regina and NW of La Jara - Prob. = Cope's second horseshoe. Similarly a very large area of good exposures. The NE part of this in Sec.31, T23N, R1W and Sec.6, T22N, R1W was worked, but no more.

3. Scattered exposures along the flank of San Pedro Mtn. east of the road and San Jose - Rio Puerco drainage from Regina to Cuba. There is no extensive area of badlands, but some material should be obtained and this region is important to determine the structural and stratigraphic relationships. For these studies, the rim of Cuba Mesa should also be followed S & SW from Cuba.

4. Head of Gavilan Arroyo, on W. side of divide. Here are extensive exposures, stratigraphically high, probably the main source of Baldwin's Meniscotherium fauna ("Largo" of Granger). A reconnaissance, at least, should also be made over the divide here and down Yegua Canon.
