58, cont.

No reason for relative concentration of small bones is apparent. Seems to be a normal clay layer, like all those in the formation, and is described partly as typical. What seems to be exactly the same stratum only a few yards away is nearly or quite barren.

As far as noted, scraps of turtle, Coryphodon, and crocodilians, much the most common fossils in the formation in general, are quite absent in this quarry. There are a few gar scales.
