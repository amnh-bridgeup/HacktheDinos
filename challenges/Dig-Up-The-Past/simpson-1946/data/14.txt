An unusually rich locality that yielded a few important specimens and
that is also typical of one of the three main sorts of bone
occurrences.

There is here a complex series of channel deposits, lenticular white
or pale sands and clays, with a maximum exposed width of ca. 1/8 mile
and a maximum thickness, or depth, of ca. 20'.

The bones occur at the very bottom of the lowest sand, i.e. near the
middle of the ancient channel in the first deposits permanently laid
down in it. The underlying clay was wet and soft when the channel
deposits began, and some bones have partly sunk down into this.

Specimens were found in site by digging along this SS-SH contact, but
the concentration, where prospected, was not such as to make extensive
quarrying profitable, the species apparently being the same as those
found in greater numbers by surface prospecting, and the preservation
no better. A steady yield of ca. 1 jaw per day per man is probable, but
not much more. As for surface finds, Coryphodon and Eohippus are the
only common mammals. Turtle fragments are extremely abundant.

No articulated or associated bones were found. Most specimens were very
fragmentary and many were mere bone pebbles. The concentration is
evidently a size-sorting of bone fragments washed into and carried along 
by the rather rapid stream.
