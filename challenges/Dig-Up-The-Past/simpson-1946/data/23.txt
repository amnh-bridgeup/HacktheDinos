will not only enclose the fossil but also spread and distort its broken
parts (e.g. #32).

Coprolites of indeterminate origin are fairly common in places, but not 
concentrated or abundant. 

No differences in the occurrence of aquatic (garfish) or amphibious 
(crocodilians) and terrestrial vertebrates were observed. 

Fossil wood is not common and in this part of the formation is usually
only as pebbles in the more conglomeratic parts of the sandstones.
(But some larger pieces of wood and logs occur in the basal ss., not
studied in detail this year.) No imprints of leaves or other vegetation
were found.

Although there is abundant evidence of the existence of an aquatic
facies, no pelecypods were found. There are rare and poor unidentifiable
impressions of parts of gastropod shells in some of the clays and a small
concentration of gastropods in the channel was found at one locality
(#63).
