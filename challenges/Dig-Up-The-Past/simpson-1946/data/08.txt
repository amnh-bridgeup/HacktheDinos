RELATIVE LEVEL OF FOSSILS - 

No section has yet been tied in from base of beds, which is not exposed in the area examined in detail in 1946. 
As a temporary datum plane, the level of the beds at the continental divide on the Regina-Lindrith road was taken. This is the pass near the center of the W 1/2 of Sec.29, T23N, R1W.
This datum level appears to be near the middleof the thickness of the formation as developed in this region.
Levels are only rough approximations, not reliable within 25-50' even for nearby localities and less for distant localities. Most fossils were found as float, in some instances at the base of exposures as much as 400' thick. It is, however, our impression that very few if any fossils collected were from more than 15-20' at most above the level on which they were found. (See next p.) No key horizon or sequence was found. Attempts to use one of the sandstone rims or red bands, for instance, were abandoned because it was found that these do not remain constant for more than a mile or two. Approximate levels as given were determined in part by tracing beds being nearly horizontal throughout the area worked.
Most of the fossils collected in 1946 are from near the same level, near the middle of the formation and in the upper part of Grangers' "Almagre." The total thickness represented in the '46 collection is only about 250-300'.
