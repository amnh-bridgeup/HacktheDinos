Facies A and B intergrade but are quite distinctive in typical development,
both stratigraphically and topographically. A usually forms a series of 
parallel skys (Canon Largo) or ridges (Yegua Can) with vertical or
steep bare ss cliffs or ledges separated by overgrown shale slopes. B
usually forms irregular, more or less overgrown hills or typical badlands
topography, with an occasional "rim" of ss like that of A. In transitional
beds between A & B, the predominance of ss may be more apparent than
real, because the shales are poorly and the ss well exposed.

In general facies A forms the lower and B the upper part of the formation,
but the relative thickness are extremely variable and there is evidently
lateral as well as vertical replacement.

Subject to more detailed study, the sudden change from facies A in the rim
of Canon Blanco to facies B at the portals of Yegua Canon, immediately
to the N, may be as much a lateral replacement as a vertical succession
(Cope's interpretation).

Very rough recon, requiring detailed checking throughout, suggests the 
following rought diagram of relationships from the lower Largo (left) to the
vicinity of La Jara.
