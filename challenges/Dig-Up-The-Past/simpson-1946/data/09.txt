LOCALITIES

Localities are given in specimen list and are also marked on topographic maps and on aerial mosaics.

The area covered in detail consists of most of the major "Wasatch" clay exposures in the central part of the eastern rim of "Almagre" Arroyo (now usually called "Red Lake Arroyo" - the name "Almagre" quite unknown to present inhabitants) southward to the NE part of the embayment SW of Regina - locally known as "the Rincon" and probably Cope's second horseshoe.

Exposures not covered within this area:

1. The SE side of the pass from Largo to "Almagre" drainages was prospected only from the Largo and as far as the hill, standing out from the main rim, near the middle of the west line of Sec.8, T23N, R1W. Northeastward from here are excellent exposures, continuous with also fine exposures in the SE part of "Almagre" Arroyo, not prospected.

2. The E side of the divide, S from "Almagre" Arroyo through sections 4, 9, 16 & 21 was not covered. Exposures are (patony?) but some may be good.

3. The W side of the divide from the middle of Sec.9 S to the pass on the Regina-Lindrith Road (Sect.29) was not covered. Exposures are poor. There is also a small area SW of this, in the SE corner 1/4 of Sec.30, not covered.

Localities to be re-examined:

1. Quarry #58 should be worked some more. See p. 30

2. Loc's 17, 18, 30, 41 & 63 merit brief re-examination, when further eroded.
