the basal Tw ss.

21 - Traversed '46. Route marked. Whole quad. is Wasatch but exposures
are mostly ss., not very promising. There are scattered small badlands
patches, the best of which is marked. (This is on Jicarilla Reservation.)
Not interesting igneous dikes, very prominent on mosaic.

22 - Not traversed and apparently never worked. Should all be Wasatch and
the mosaic seems to show good exposures.

23 - Traversed SE -> NW down Largo, as marked. SS extensively exposed in
Largo and tributaries, shale exposures present but very patchy. Great
basal Tw ss series. Reeside '24 shows bottoms of Companero, Largo, &
Blanco around & above intersection in this quad. as Torrejon - Dubious?
It will be worthwhile to spend some time in here on Torrejon - Wasatch
transition.

24 - Traversed as shown. Mainly Torrejon. Includes the great Kutz Canon - 
Angel Peak basin worked by Granger in 1916.

25 - Traversed '46 only down San Juan and up Animas. (Also repeatedly
S of Farmington in 1929). Some Torrejon. No Wasatch.

32 - Intensive work in '46. Notes elsewhere.

33 - Thoroughly traversed '46, as shown. All Wasatch. Many but mostly
small Tw. exposures around Lindrith and down N. fork of Largo. Big area
in head of Gavilan - IMPORTANT. Not much elsewhere.
