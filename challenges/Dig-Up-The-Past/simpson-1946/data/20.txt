STRUCTURE:

In the area examined in detail, N rim of Red Lake ("Almagre") Arroyo to
NE part of the Rincon SW of Regina, about 9 mi. N & S and about 3 mi. E & W,
the beds are almost horizontal throughout.

On the SW branch of Red Lake Arroyo probably true dip between 1 & 2 degrees
between S. & S.W. was observed. (Sect's 4-5 of T23N, R1W.) In the area 
between and around Sect's 8-31 of this township no regional dip was 
observed although in places there are local apparent or probably dips, 1-2
degrees, approximately W or between W & SW. In many places there seems to
the eye to be a decided dip, but this is either a false dip or illusory,
not confirmed by instruments.

The dip everywhere in this area being very slight or nil, its precise 
measurement is difficult and unreliable. The only sharp contact planes are
those on the ss's and these are usual at an angle to the true bedding. Dip
must usually be taken by sighting on long exposures of the banded clays,
and even these apparently regular bands do not necessarily represent
true bedding, as they may be seen to diverge or converge when followed
to considerable distances.

Small sandstone dikes are fairly common, from a fraction of an inch up to
6" or so thick. They are nearly vertical and although often sinuous tend to
be rectilincar and usually run between N-S and NE-SW. The fissuring that
they represent seems to be intra-formational. No noticeable fault movement
on these fissures was detected, nor were any other faults seen in this area
except very small localized slips of a fraction of an inch apparently due
only to compacting.
