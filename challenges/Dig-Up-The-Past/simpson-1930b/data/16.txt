not an impression, but a silicified leaf,  
dicotyledonous.  The same beds contain rare  
bones apparently all reptilian (no trace of  
deities dinosaurs however), turtles and  
crocodiles.  In a clay lens intercolated in  
these beds was found most of the skeleton of  
a crocodile (#334), lacking head (weathered  
out and lost) and tail (lost before burial). 
In this baranca the Banco Verde thus grades  
from south to north from a definitely marine  
bed into definitely terrestrial deposits, beach  
or deltaic, with much jetsom. 
BANCO NEGRO ? At FB the Banco Negro  
is fairly typical, black to grey clay grading  
into the tuffs above & with lenses of sand &  
concretions.  No fossils were found.  The  
contact with the Banco Verde, where this is  
marine, is sharp and discordant.  At FA the  
Banco Negro is hardly recognizable, except  
from its position.  It consists of grey clay  
and fine sand & is apparently conformable  
on the Banco Verde equivalent, here  
likewise non-marine.   (See)(P.194)
