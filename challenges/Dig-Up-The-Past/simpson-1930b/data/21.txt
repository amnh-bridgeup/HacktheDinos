	Note on association of Eocene  
mammals &Salamanqueano at Las Violetas. 
 
	At Las Violetas the terminal part of  
the Salamanqueano contains in places  
sandstones identical in appearance with  
those, which contain mammals.  Pieces of  
the mammal-sandstone were found lying on  
this and indistinguishable from it except for  
having mammal bone fragments, found in  
place about 160' above (the cliff between  
almost vertical).  Arneghino's statements  
that the Salamanqueano in places ends with  
a shore deposit with mingled shells &  
Netosylopense is perhaps thus explained.
