mammals in its upper part, sometimes also  
at other levels down to its base. 
3.	Pale clays 100'+, gray- 
greenish or yellowish, less often pink with a  
lesser amount of intercolated sandstones, x- 
bedded, fine to coarse, sometimes well  
cemented.  These sandstones, generally  
white to grey rarely pink or reddish, contain  
mammals, although local, rare, and poorly  
preserved. 
4.	A series (unmeasured)  
predominantly sandy but with much clay  
also, often brightly colored.  The lower part  
is usually more argillaceous & often has a  
black clay (true banco negro) at its base.     
The upper part is formed by a thick (100' or  
more) sandstone to fine conglomerate with  
rather rare intercolated clays, usually brick  
red but also containing white and green  
lenses.  This whole series appears barren.   
There are various not well-authenticated  
reports of finding dinosaurs in it.  The most  
clearly circumstantial is a bone, clearly  
dinosaur, in the possession of Rossbach of  
the Y. P. F. which he says was given him by  
the late R, Wichmann as coming from the  
surface between Pico Salamanca & Punto  
Vissor.  Suggestive but not direct enough to  
be certain.  On the other hand mammal  
bones, otherwise unidentifiable, were found  
at sea level near section GB, apparently, but  
not surely in place.  Until more definite  
finds are made, the series must be  
considered barren or essentially so.
