Is ca. 105' above the arg. fis. But below it  
are two or more thinner beds of similar  
character, one near the level of that on the  
other side of the Canadon.  It seems to me  
impossible to assume (as Feruglio) that a  
single "tosquilla" bank can be distinguished   
& to infer an unconformity from its  
variation in level. 
	Mammals, although so few in  
number, may be found either above or below  
the main tosquilla. 
	At the place where HB was taken the  
Patagoniano was completely eroded away in  
the Pleistocene, although it occurs nearby.   
The Pleistocene deposit, Tehuelche, consists  
chiefly pf typical rodados in a sandy matrix,  
cemented very hard and looking very like  
artificial concrete, also grey sand, some  
cemented and some soft.  These rocks  
contain broken pieces of Ostrea hatchem,  
but no original marine fossils so far as  
observed.  They are approximately 300'  
above sea level.

	Here on the SE side of the Mazaredo  
uplift a section similar to that on the NW  
side reappears (profile TA).  At the base are  
silicified tuffs identical in appearance with  
the argile fissilaires of Canadon Lobo.   
Above are tuffs and tuffaceous clays, also of  
the same character as those at the l;atter  
locality, & then the Patagoniano. 
	One the NW sideour work & all  
previous publication agrees that only  
Notostylopense fossils are found.  Similarly  
on the SE only Pyrotheriano.  Three  
interpretations are possible: 
1.	The  
Pyrotheriano has been removed on the NW  
by pre-Patagonianoerosion.  The silicifies  
tuffs of the SE are bot true argiles fissilaires,  
but a facies between the fossiliferous Notosti  
& Pyroth.  This apparentely was Ameghinos  
view.  It is unlikelybecause of the identity in  
character of the arg,fis. & the SE silicified  
tuff & the slmost continuous interveining  
exposures.
