Barancas, but in relatively gentle slopes  
above the baranca, covered usually with  
sand & rodados & often overgrown. 
Many exposures in this part are   
Palagomano, but where the bedding is  
visible it is usually irregularly filled are  
there are apparently slumped blocks.  C. S.  
W. found marine fossils immediately above  
the black clay apparently in place but also  
surely also slumped. 
I did not succeed in surely establishing the  
"Eocene" Patagoniano contact.  The highest  
rather surely terrestrial beds were about 100'  
above the "arg. fis." And not far above was  
Patagoniano  apparently in place.   
I believe the thickness of the "Eocene" is  
about 100'-150' here.  [Feruglio gives 60- 
70m. = 195'-230' for Las Violetas, 80m. =  
260' for Malaspina]. 
The elevation of the Salamanqueano ?  
Pehuenche contact, somewhat variable, is  
approximately that of the top of the Tetas  
ole Pinedo (hand leveled) = 275-280m. ca.  
900'-920'.

LAS TETAS DE PINEDO 
Observations here confirmed ands did not  
add to the remarks of Windhausen &  
Feruglio. 
BUSTAMANTE 
During our short stay here we examined the  
porphyries of Poninsola Gravina or Punta  
Ullea.  We did not see the reef deposits,  
covered by the tide at the time of our visit. 
LOS MELLIZOS 
These are two hills at the Subida Grande de  
Hansen.  The bases are Salamanqueano,  
with typical fossils.  The Banco Verde is  
characteristic, its top at an elevation of  
approximately 150-155m. = 492'-508'.  The  
contact with the Banco Negro is plane and  
parallel broadly, but is sharp and uneven in  
small details.
