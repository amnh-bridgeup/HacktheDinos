Remarks, LAS TORTUGAS 
For convenience of record, we apply the  
name "Las Tortugas" to the baranca about 2  
leagues almost due north of Puerto Visser.   
Hew the series upper Salamanqueano to the  
Pataganiano is well exposed. 
At or very near the top of the Banco Verde   
& immediately beneath the Banco Negro are  
very local thin lenses of shell breccia, with  
limited mollusc fauna & numerous shark  
teeth.  In some places these small lenses are  
almost pure shell limestone, in others nearby  
are white sand with numerous shells.  # 328  
is a good representation of the fauna of this  
unusual bed. 
The transition from Banco Verde to Banco  
Negro appears concordant, but may well not  
be so.  The Banco Verde is here clearly  
marine, although perhaps coastal, the Banco  
Negro probably terrestrial.   
The Banco typical green  (P185)
