end of the baranca, X-bedded fine green  
sandstones, withes lenses and bands of red  
sandstone, numerous large concretions of  
the same sandstone.  In places the rock is  
"fucoidal" (R 129).  Following this bed  
laterally there appear in the upper part lenses  
of coarse, hard, grey Xbedded sandstone,  
sometimes (when somewhat finer grained)  
with filled sun-cracks and other subacrial  
markings.  The upper part also grades  
laterally into thin bedded platy , grey fine  
sandstones.  In these no marine fossils were  
observed.   
At profile FA the exposed part of the Banco  
Verde equivalent is almost entirely  
composed of these atypical non-marine  
sediments ? thin - bedded     
grey sandstone in broad lenses overlying &  
grading laterally & vertically into thicker  
fine and very coarse X-bedded grey to  
somewhat greenish sandstones.  These  
contain innumerable pieces of fossil wood,  
from large trunks about 2'in diameter  down  
to fine twigs.  In places the rock is full of  
small pieces of solidified twigs, ivory or  
cream colored to bright green, & one leaf  
was found  (P 192)
