Remarks, Cerro Redondo 
 
We give the new name "Cerro Redondo" for  
our own convenience of record to the round  
hill one league almost due west Puerto  
Visser.  The section was taken  
barometrically, checked by leveling, in a  
SSW-NNE direction from the deep zanjon  
south of the hill in which the upper beds of  
the Salamanqueano are exposed.  
Mammals surely in place were found in sand  
about 37 meters above the Salamanqueano.   
As usual in such continental deposits, there  
are numerous local (& possible regional)  
uncomformities, but no real break in three  
series can be detected stratigraphically.  
The section is about 4-5 km. Distant from  
the localities where mammals were found in  
the tuffs at Lomas Blancas.  In the large  
baranca just across the Zanjon from Cerro  
Redondo & facing 
 
 
P181 
North an almost identical series is exposed.   
Judging from these, top of the Cerro is very  
close to the level of the "Eocene" tuffs  
intercolated between the sand-clay series  
and the Patagoniano.
