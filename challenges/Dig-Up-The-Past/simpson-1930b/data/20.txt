W. END OF PAMPITA DE 
LA LOMA REDONDA 
This pampita is the small plateau that  
extends westward from the Estancia Hansen.   
At its western end almost due NW of Los  
Melligos and about 4-1/2 kilometers W. &  
slightly N. of the Estancia Hansen the  
"Pehuenche" is well exposed.  A simplifies  
section is given in Profile FC, P. 193. 
The essential features, in descending order  
are as follows: 
At the top, rodados of course, & thin lenses  
of yellowish tuff, perhaps the base of an  
eroded series. 
About 50' of sandstones & clays.  Near the  
top hard grey X-bedded ss. Such as that with  
mammals at Las Violetas: R 144. The sands  
in general are grey to bright red:R 143.   
Some of the intercolated clays are thin  
bedded & fissile.  At or near the base of this  
series in some places is black clay: R 142. 
About 90' pf grey-green sands:R 140 &  
sandy tuffs almost identical in character with  
those at Las Violetas, likewise with pebbles  
of pumice, etc. The "Arg. Fis." Is lacking  
except that the  
 
 
P.199 
Top of the grey-green is hardened &  
weathers brown & testicular: R 141, and that  
another similar thin (app'ly lenticular) bed is  
intercolated in the grey-green below. 
15' yellowish sand and grey clay, with many  
fibrous radiating concretions near the base. 
10'+-Fairly typical  Banco Negro Banco Verde. 
 
The chief importance of this section is as  
intermediate between Las Violetas & Las  
Tortugas (see p. 193).  It is strongly  
suggestive of equivalence as shown, which  
would seems to lend to the very important  
conclusion that the "Pehuenche" above the  
upper black clay at Las Tortugas is  
equivalent to the "Eocene" of Las Violetas.
