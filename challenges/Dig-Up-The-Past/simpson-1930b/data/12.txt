Notes ? LAS TORTUGAS 
Cont. from p182 
Sands are generally overlain by about 3' of  
green clay with which it does not appear  
intergraded, although with uneven contact &  
inclusions or injections of one in the other.   
The upper part of the green clay is spotty,  
fragmentary, with some fragments like &  
perhaps injected from the overlying Banco  
Negro.  The contact of this above 
Is usually sharp, often slipped.  The Banco  
Negro here is always rather patchy &  
fragmentary, its base contains fragments of  
green clay.  A parallel discordance  
"disconformity" is indicated, its value, of  
course, unknown.
