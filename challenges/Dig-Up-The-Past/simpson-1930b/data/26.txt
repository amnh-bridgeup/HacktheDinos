barren upper parts of this tuff series, & no  
fossils have been found here so far as I  
know.

 REGION OF MAZAREDO 
The interest of this region is due to a broad  
anticline which brings pre-Patagoniano  
rocks to the surface along the coast from  
Punta Casamayor to a point between Punta  
Nava and Bahia Sanquinetti, studied by  
Ameghino (both C. & F. in person & by  
many others (e.g. Feruglio) 
The central part, that near the embayment of  
Mazaredo itself, is occupied by argiles  
fissilaires (typical locality) beneath which at  
the crest of the uplift are limited exposures  
of dark to black clay (upper Pehuenche by  
Y.P.F. usage).  The tuffs are not well seen  
here although according to Feruglio's  
geologic sketch (& contrary to Ameghino)  
they occur even on the crest. 
The Tertiary tuffs are well exposed in the  
first Canadon SE of Punta Casamayor, but  
more fully in the second Canadon, locally  
called Canadon Lobo ? the same as  
Ameghino's Canadon Tournouer where the  
following sections were taken:
