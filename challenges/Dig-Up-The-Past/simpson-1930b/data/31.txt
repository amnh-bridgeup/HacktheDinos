2.	The  
silicified tuff at the SE is the same as the  
NW argiles fissilaires.  In the SE the  
Notosylopense has been removed by pre- 
Pyrotheriano erosion (hense the two are  
uncomformable) & to the NW the  
Pyrotheriano is removed by pre-Pataganiano  
erosion.  This appears the mpst probable  
explanation. 
3.	The  
non-fossiliferous basal tuffs in the SE are  
Notosylopense, thinner here (by much) than  
in the NW, probably but not surely due to  
pre-pyrotheriano  erosion while in the NW  
the unfossiliferous upper tuffs are  
Pyrotheriano.  This seems not improbable,  
but evidence is absent.

At the locality of IA fossils are extremely  
rare, but do occur (unident.) in the 20' of  
mottled fine tuffs.  Ca. 3 km, farther east,  
fossils are fairly abundant.  A section was  
not taken.  C,S.W. furnishes following:   
At base ca. 20', of silicified tuff, with  
limonite nodules.  Above this 35'-40' of  
yellowish tuff, bedded and varying in  
hardness.  This contains mammals   
throughout but richer toward the top (#342).   
Then follows a massive pinkish tuff  of great  
thickness, very approximately 78'-100'.
