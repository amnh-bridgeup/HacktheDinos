            CANADON LOBO 
 
	Fossils are very rare.  We found  
bones in situ at horizons on both sides of the  
Canadon as marked on profile, but only one  
identifiable specimen, horizon uncertain. 
	The argiles fillisllaires consist of  
regularly bedded, harder and softer beds, the  
hard beds consisting of silicified tuff, here  
grey to yellow, sometimes with limonite  
nodules.  The fracture is conchoidal & very  
irregular but in places there is a system of  
more or less parallel vertical joints &  
sometimes-another less definite & about  
right angles to the first.  
	The contact of arg. fis. & The  
overlying tuffs is parallel  & apparently  
concordant.  Although fairly sharp, there are  
two beds of typical silicified tuff above the  
contact, & others similar but not identical,  
so that the two series seem to intergrade.   
	Within the tuffs there is tusquilla,  
15'+or- in thickness & ca. 40' above the arg.  
fis. On the N side.  On the south side the  
main tusquilla likewise 15'+or-=(see p. 216)
