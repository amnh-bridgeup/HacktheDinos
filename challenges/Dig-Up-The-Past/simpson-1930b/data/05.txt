miles) and probably is the same. 
8. Beneath this is a series of clays, quite  
concordant to the base of the continuous  
section over 170'.  The upper part is very  
tuffaceous, with many beds of fairly pure  
but fine tuff the lower sandy.  A visible but  
artificial separation is into thick upper  
tuffaceous beds, a middle series with opaline  
concretions, and a lower sandy series.  The  
upper tuffaceous beds contain numerous  
bone fragments but very much broken up &  
generally minute ? no identifiable ones were  
found. 
About 75' below the top of these are lenses  
of sandstone up to 4' thick, rather hard,  
coarse, grey but often weathering orange,  
similar to the so-called Pehuenche type.   
There also unidentifiable bone fragments  
were found.  This is exactly similar macro- 
scopically to the sandstone with mammals in  
Cahaclon Hondo (profile CD, p 136) But the  
surrounding beds are not similar in the two  
cases.
