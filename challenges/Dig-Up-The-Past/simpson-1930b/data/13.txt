The massive red sands near the top of the  
section given are noted by Feruglio, who  
places in them a discordant (ll) contact  
between K & T.  I did not spend much time  
on these, but saw no obvious basis for this.  
There are erosional disconformities at  
various levels & in various places, but I am  
unable to discern a single regional erosion  
surface.   
Miolania is common in the Banco Negro  
(confining (?) to basal clay above  
Salamanqueano) but mostly very  
fragmentary.  I saw only two in place, both  
about 10' above the Salamanqueano one a  
few plate fragments, the other a fair part of a  
carapace,

LAS VIOLETAS 
Below (SE) Of the buildings of the Estancia  
Las Violetas de Alfonso Menendez Behey  
begins a large baranca which continues  
southward for approximately two leagues.   
The baranca below Malaspina is a  
continuation northward of the same baranca.   
This part was not examined due to lack of  
time, but as seen with largavista &  
according to the notes of Dr. E. Feruglia is  
of the same character as that of Las Violetas. 
Profile FA was made near the north end of  
the Las Violetas baranca, profile FB near the  
south end, nearly two leagues distant in a  
straight line and farther along the very  
sinuous cliff front.  
BAVCO VERDE: The foot of the cliff is  
generally formed by the Banco Verde,  
terminal Salamanqueano,  intermittently  
exposed along the promontories of the  
baranca.  Below it, seldom well exposed but  
clearly seen in profile FB for instance, is the  
fragmentosa with marine fossils, Grypheca  
Pyrotheriorum, Oatica spp; another  
pelecypod, Turritella sp., sharks and rays  
(I7). The Banco Verde is fairly typical near  
the southern
