P176, 
Remarks, Lomas Blancas 
This region is one very much disturbed by  
faults and slips, so that only a general idea  
of the succession can be obtained.  The  
essential point is the presence between the  
clay-white sandstone series and the  
Patagoniano tuff of a relatively then series  
of terrotrial tuffs. 
These are very massive, appear to be  
absolutely concordant.  They have a  
thickness of 100'-150', hard to determine  
because of the structure & frequent slips on  
the underlying clays. 
The accompanying simple sections of this  
part of the series were taken independently  
about 3 km. Apart.  
We saw no signs of Pyrotherium beds.
