 REGION OF PICO SALAMANCA 
 
	This region was studied especially in  
five typical locations (others by  
reconnaissance) 
1.	Vicinity of Punta  
Peligro. 
2.	  Property of Compania  
Carmen de Petrolco. 
3.	Nr. Pico Chico, N. of  
Pico Salamanca.  
4.	Coast south of Pico  
Salamanca 
5.	S. W. of Pico Salamanca  
& N. W. of Bahia Salano. 
The beds have a very gentle southward dip. 
	At Punta Peligro the upper  
Salamanqueano is exposed and more inland  
the whole series to lower Pataganiano.   The  
Salamanqueano disappears immediately  
south of here. /  At localities just south of  
the peak the terrestrial tuffs and underlying  
sandstones and clays are exposed.  The pass  
soon below sea level and do not appear on  
the south side of the Solano emboyment.   
The tuffs continue southward until their top  
disappears beneath the tide level  
immediately north of Comoduro.  Between  
Comoduro and the vicinity of Punta  
Casamayor, far south, the oldest rocks are of  
the Patagoniano. 
	In the Pico Salamanca region there  
are five chief series distinguishable, in  
ascending order: 
1.	Lower Patagoniano or  
Juliense, Marine tuffs & sandstones with  
Ostrea Hatchers  and many other molluscs  
etc. 
2.	300'-400' of tuffs and  
tuffaceous clays without sand or gravel &  
white or pale yellowish, pinkish, buff in  
color.  The upper 100'-200'very massive  
and barren so far as observed.  The rest  
somewhat faintly stratified and generally  
with
