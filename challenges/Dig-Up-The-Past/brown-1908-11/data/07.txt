found at river level a mile above Content a Trachodon humerus poorly preserved bones were found at nearly every stop made from there on down but nothing of value until we reached the mouth of Big Valley where on the opposite west side of the river numerous bones were found especially a large quarry. Bones were most numerous in two sandstone layers about 20 and 30 ft above the river at this point. A single fragmentary skeleton was found in the first coal seam about 160 feet above the river which up that that time was the only Ceratopoian remains observed. Conditions

were evidently quite different here from what they were during Laramie times and the fauna is very distinct. Trachodons are by far the most abundant (remains) large and small species but all observed having the older type of pappilate teeth. One distal end of tibia seen was 14 inches across transversely, the largest known. Two distinct levels for bones occur in these beds a lower one where Trachodons are most abundant which appears in two sandstone layers the ripper one forty feet above the river and an ripper one near the top of the formation in yellow sand and clay. This is the level in which
