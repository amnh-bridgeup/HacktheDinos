Muirs observation upon Glaciers 
Extend from the Sierras and Yosemite 
to Alaska. 
On the highside of the Yosemite areGla- 
cial scratches, and 1800 feet above 
the valley level is a lateral moraine ? 
partly covered by brush and under- 
growth. 
  We attribute mountain forces mainly 
to Glacial action. The high sharp sum- 
mits and amphitheatres are carved by 
the descents.  The rounded foot-hills, 
by the over-sweep of the Glacier. 
 
In the Yosemite the great piles of talu 
under the cliffs are due to earth- 
quakes.  We experienced a sharp 
earthquakes and running out into 
the moonlight, witnessed the tumbling 
over of Eagle Rock.  The growth of 
larger trees t the foot of these 
cliffs proves that the fall of the 
talus is exceptional or unusual.
