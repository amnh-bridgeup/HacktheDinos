sisting of the Forestry Commission.(Lar- 
gent, Hague, Brewer, Richot) were 
watching the Excelsior Geyser Basin 
(Hell's half acre) when a Chicago man 
came up and observed, "I wish I had 
that basin at home, it would be a 
grand place to scald hogs in." 
 
This was paralled by ?? C. of Tray- 
a collar and cuff manufacturer- be- 
longing to our Raymond party ? Perry 
pointed out to him the beautiful 
deep blue color of a recently over- 
turned berg in Laku inlet ? and he 
said : "Yes that is just the color 
collars and cuffs ought to have 
in coming out of the blueing pot." 
 
I am struck by the general courtesy, 
good nature and especially good 
manners of the passengers and the 
admirable service of the stewards.
