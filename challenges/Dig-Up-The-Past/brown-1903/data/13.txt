Worked on skeleton today but 
shale was so wet that I merely 
cut down the sides of the matrix and 
let it dry out.  Did not try to 
plaster the slabs.  Found some 
fish vertebrae three inches in 
diameter also several tails and 
skulls.  Baculites are very 
numerous all through the 
shales and are crushed 
flat.  Some are two and a half 
feet long. 
  Heard the first coyote chorus 
this morning. 
 
  Had a heavy frost last night.  The 
alkali water was too much for me 
last night, felt sick all morning 
so prospected the other two blowouts 
close to camp.  Found several fish 
skulls and the first Pterydactyls 
bones discovered in the Fort Pierre 
formation of this is such; they are 
merely fragments but unmistakable 
  In the afternoon I rode Billy 
over to Cottonwood Creek about 
ten miles west.  Found very few 
blowouts and no fossils.  In country 
seems of limited area, confined 
to the one horizon of black shale. 
Saw two coyotes and two antelopes 
this afternoon
