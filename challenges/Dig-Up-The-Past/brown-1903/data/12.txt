 Finished loading and pulled 
south about twenty miles camping 
on a tributary of Indian Creek 
at night. 
  Country seems to be Fort Pierre formation 
collected some invertebrates and 
located saurian bones near the road 
as it comes out over the first black shale 
ledge on east side of Cottonwood Creek 
These bones were in limestone concretions 
and concretions contain Baculites 
and fish remains as well 
From Edgemont south on the Cottonwood 
these are several successive 
ledges of sandstone of ??? yellow 
containing in the lowest ledge only 
Mytalis very abundant; rocks composed 
entirely of these shells in places 
The next sandstone layer contains 
mostly scaphites 
 
  Spent today collecting fish remains 
in the black shale blow outs 
near last night?s camp.  Found a 
complete mosasaur skeleton, uncrushed, 
in shale:  Easy to work out.  Very little 
concretion mixed in with it. 
  Found great numbers of fish 
remains, skull, jaws and parts 
of skeletons though few were 
connected.  Made a permanent 
camp in a tributary of Indian Creek 
south of blowout on Old Cheyenne 
Deadwood trail. 
  It rained in the afternoon making 
camp disagreeable.  Water so heavily 
saturated with gypsum and other 
salts that it cannot be used for 
drinking or wash water.  Get water 
from the pools in top of hills.
