  Reached Harrison and found Mr Conard 
awaiting me.  Drove out to his place this 
evening 14 miles S.W. Harrison. 
  All the country is mountainous and  
covered with Carboniferous limestone 
and sandstone containing crinoid stems 
spirifers and productus; the 
crinoids in great abundance 
The ledges are seamed by crevasses 
in all directions while in many 
places these open into caves 
No bones have been discovered any 
where over the country except in 
this locality where Mr. Conard struck 
so many while pinking a shaft  
for zinc.  On the surface this 
place does not differ seemingly 
from the surrounding hill except 
that there appears to be filled in 
crevasses running east and west 
and such it undoubtedly is. 
For 8 feet below the surface no 
bones were found but from there
