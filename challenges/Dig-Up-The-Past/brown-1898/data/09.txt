Stranger wandering on while we proceed  
on our journey.  Two young ladies on the  
after deck give Saltpere and I no end of  
speculation as they wave us adios standing  
in the rain.  The first sight of the starry  
banner I have had in over a year and it  
seems like a letter from home.   
Can not define much of shore on account of  
rain and fog. 
Sun came out clear and bright about two  
o'clock just of Cape Penas or Rio Grande  
where Menendez has a large settlement the  
farthermost south.  Coast line irregular  
apparently no level pampas as on the  
continent.
