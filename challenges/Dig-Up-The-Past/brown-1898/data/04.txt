wouldn't sail until today abt, 1. 
Naturally every few minutes I would  
think of something else that I  wanted to take  
and getting these things kept me busy until  
evening when I went up to see Paul at his  
residence with Mr. Hatch to alter our  
agreements.  Arranging matters satisfactorily;  
I determined to see Jersey friends once more  
but didn't reach East Orange  till nearly all the girls  
had retired.  Miss Newton kindly volunteered  
to awaken them to which I consented  and we  
completed the day or night rather to my  
enjoyment.   Dr. Meeker thought I was  
Brown's ghost when I asked admittance  
thinking I had gone to S. A.  
This morning at eleven I came down to  
the pier of 30th St. and found a few people  
still working around though all the cargo  
work on board and the Blue Peter fluttered at  
the masthead 

telling friends that we were all ready to sail.   
At 1 o'clock the pilot came on board, and a  
snorting, wheezing little tug began pulling us  
out into the Hudson at 2:30.  A few goodbyes  
and we are off.  Who can describe the  
sensation?  Regrets that you are leaving home  
and friends mixed with the glory of new  
discoveries  and the wonders of a long sea  
voyage and a new country.   But I haven't  
time for this; the Captain says the pilot leaves  
the ship just off Sandy Hook and he will be  
the last chance to send off any letter till we  
reach Sandy Point so I wrote farewell letter  
for the next two hours missing most of the  
lower river scenery.  Came on deck in time to  
see the Statue of  Liberty in the distance .   
The little tug has left us and we are sailing  
under our own steam.  Went up on the bridge  
where I could see a few buildings and old  
Fort Williams in the distance. Pass a  buoy
