And causing the ship to roll and pitch; 
the stern raising twenty feet and then 
falling with that sickening swing 
motion.The sea must be beautiful 
now but I can't appreciate it.   
 
Dec. 11th 
Heavy squalls with rain again today.  
The sea is high and the ship pitches 
like a bronco.
I am still hors de combat.  
 
Dec. 12th 
My companions in misery and myself are  
feeling better.  I begins to get some 
milder so one can be on deck.  
Captain brought out cards, games and 
a gramophone today. Seems rather odd 
to be several hundreds of miles at 
sea and still enjoy some of the  
musical luxuries 
 
of life.  What a change invention 
has made in the last century.  We have 
the crowd playing poker tonight and 
the ship's rolling and pitching.  
I don't have to stretch my  
imagination much to see Kidd and 
his men at cards.  I have been 
feeding the gramophone with plates.  
Have heard better, still this is 
good.  Have found out why  mermaids 
send "La Miserere" in La Travatori ; 
The poor fellow was sea sick.
