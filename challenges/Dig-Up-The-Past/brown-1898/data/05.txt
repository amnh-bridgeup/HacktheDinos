once in a while, its ding dong bell 
warning us of shallow water.  How 
different the same  bell may sound at 
different times.  To people coming 
home it must ring only a welcome,  
though it does sound a trifle mournful 
to me  starting on a thirty day cruise.   
We passed Sandy Hood, which by the way, 
doesn't look so formidable with its low 
batteries though most of its guns are 
concealed. 4:45 Pilot left the boat.  
Way off to the south in the promontory 
the light is flashing its warning  
light at intervals reminding me of the 
heliograph signals I saw at Denver 
flashing from Pikes Peak. 5:15 we 
passed Scotland Light ships abeam and 
we are off the deep blue ocean. The 
Sandy Hook light is nearly out of  
sight at sundown and the steward
has rung the bell for supper. 
 
 
Dec. 8 
 
Never slept better than last night.  Today  
began the learn something about the ship and  
companions.  Captain Spuril(?) reminds me  
very much of father.  Has sailed in many seas  
and ships; seems solicitous of the welfare of  
all the passengers.  1st mate is a big burly  
fellow who directs all the work of the  
forecastle men.  His name is Thos. Gibson  
which somehow seems too mild for him.  J.  
T. Rise is 2nd Officer.  Then is 3rd Officer.   
There are six passengers, Messer's Hatcher  
and Petersin with whom I am going, a  
Peruvian,  Wadsworth Cjilian Berrows and a  
Mr. Fowler who goes to Punta Arenas.  The  
S.S.Capac is a vessel 320 feet long and about  
30 feet wide.
