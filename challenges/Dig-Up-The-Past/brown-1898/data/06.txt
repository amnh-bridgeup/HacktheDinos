Oh:  That funny feeling.  I've had it all day.   
Haven't begun short watches below yet, have  
felt that way all day/ 
	The only time I feel normal is lying  
down.

Still have it: Wouldn't have cared all day  
whether the ship had gone to the bottom or  
not.  I always though I wouldn't be sick.  But  
like that other poor fellow who hung over the  
rail, I have watched everything come up but  
the moon. 
I can now sympathize with Miss Sanford. 
Fresh air, they say is good for one, but I  
don't care to walk after it.  The sea has  
been heavy today, great white capped  
combers dashing over the rail
