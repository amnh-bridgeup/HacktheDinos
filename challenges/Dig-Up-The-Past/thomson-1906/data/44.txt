  This season I went 
back to the locality 
we worked last year with intentions of 
doing work on a large scale.  On my 
arrival I immediately went to see Mr. 
H.L. Ashbrook, owner of 
the property and he 
refused to give us permission to work.  
We tried to lease or purchase, 
but did not 
succeed.  Toward the end of the season 
We made him an offer of $200.00 per annum. 
But upon his consideration he raised it to 
$400.00 with certain restrictions.  
That was First ? 
a small party.  
Secondonly two acres at each 
of the two localities.  
One of these localities 
being where Hesperopithecus 
had been found by 
Harold Cook in 1916. 
  However I deemed it 
ridiculous to lease at 
such a high rate, consequently did not 
until I could see Prof. Osborn, 
who agreed with 
me. 
Not being able to work on Mr.Ashbrook's
place, I got permission to work on Mr. 
Kilpatrick's ranch.
The Kilpatrick's being 
more or less interested in our work. 
  We worked the Snake Creek Beds in the
western end of their very large pasture, 
but did 
not succeed in 
locating a good quarry.  We 
found the usual amount of 
scrappy material. 
  After giving up the 
Snake Creek Beds to a 
certain extent we began working a Sheep 
Creek channel bed in the same pasture 
And succeeded in securing a very fair 
Collection though 
more or less fragmentary ?
