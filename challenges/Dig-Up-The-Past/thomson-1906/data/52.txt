  This season did not see us in 
the field until quite late in June. 
  We began our work by opening 
a prospect which we discovered in 
1925 known as the Grass Roots quarry 
or quarry No.6.  In a few days 
we had exhausted this quarry so 
we set to work in our old 
Kilpatrick pasture quarry or quarry No.7. 
where we worked until the close 
of the season. 
  We met with our usual success 
in this quarry, securing many 
supposed fossil bone implements 
a few so called Prosthenops teeth 
horse + camel jaws, many 
isolated teeth, some carnivore
