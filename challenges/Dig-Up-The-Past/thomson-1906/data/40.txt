Expedition 1920 
Agate Springs Quarry.

From June 20th to Oct 28th 
 
Began excavating at N. Western end of 
the old quarry, 
where work was left off in 
1914.  A cut about 100 ft. 
by 20 ft was begun 
and worked down about 15 ft.  
Then the cut was 
cut in half down to 
bone layer which was about 
15 ft more.  
At the bone layer we came in 
contact with the 
original channel bed bank 
which cut off 
about half of our expected 
uncovering.  
Though just in beyond this bank 
a very good pocket occurred.  
Rhinoceros 
material principally.  
Though a great deal 
of Moropus as well, 
which undoubtedly belongs 
to skeletons already collected in 1914. 
No signs of Dinohyus 
material all season, 
but if any more occur in 
the hill there is 
reason to believe it should be 
found in this 
pocket, if we keep working in,  
Though from 
now on we must do tunneling. 
 
For convenience of record 
I have numbered 
this seasons 
Moropus material No.15 15x15A +B to +16 
be kept in one lab until prepared and 
assembled with 
Moropus skeletons already 
prepared at the Museum. 
  A great deal of Rhinoceros 
material was also 
collected, though we 
found it very difficult to 
preserve Rhino. 
Material while taking out 
Moropus. 
  The last large Moropus 
skeleton No16 consisted 
of nearly all the ribs, 
hind limbs, lumbars 
1/2 of pelvis, and probably 
skull + jaws belong to this 
individual and also a 
very large scapula, ulna 
radius + humerus all numbered 15. 
(written along side : 11321) 
  A few bones under No18 were 
found near what 
we called the bank and 
rather higher than 
the rest. 
  The quarry was closed 
for the season Oct. 28.
