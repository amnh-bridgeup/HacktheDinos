 Altogether we secured about 1200 pounds 
(10 boxes) of material. 
The last couple of weeks were spent in 
packing and boxing our material and 
also looking over some 
Upper Harrison beds 
though we fond nothing of importance. 
  I also prospected around the old Agate 
Spring Quarry and 
succeed in locating the 
bone layer about 50 yards to 
the east of the 
old quarry.  The bones being in the hard 
matrix but exceptionally fine, and not 
as thickly deposited.  I think this new 
section should be looked into more 
thoroughly, as it is quite 
easily gotten at 
and our long looked for Dinohyus may 
turn up. 
  On November 4th a bad blizzard came 
which stopped our field work and 
prevented us from getting our machines 
and fossils to the rail road.So we left 
everything at Agate, Nebr. until roads 
are passable, when 
Mr. George L. Gislach of 
Harrison Nebr. is to go down after them 
put the machines in 
storage for the winter 
and bill our collection out by express.
