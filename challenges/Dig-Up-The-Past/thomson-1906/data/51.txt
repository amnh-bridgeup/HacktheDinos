We were fortunate enough to 
locate another quarry in Mr. 
Kilpatrick's pasture which proved 
as good or better than the one 
on Mr. Ashbrook's land.  The 
Kilpatrick people very generously 
gave us permission to work in 
their pasture. 
  This new quarry we called 
the Kilpatrick quarry until 
Prof. Osborn gave it a number, 
No.7.  We worked this quarry from 
Aug 1st until we closed the season, 
with fair success, finding 
many so called Hesperopithecus 
teeth which later proved to be 
mostly Prosthenops teeth. 
  We found a great many curious- 
ly worked pieces which may 
possibly be the workings of a 
Pliocene human being, if they 
are not, nature has certainly 
played her part beautifully at 
the faker's game.
