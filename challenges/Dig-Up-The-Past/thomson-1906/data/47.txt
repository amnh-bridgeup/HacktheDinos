 We had hopes of securing 
a Dinohyus skeleton 
but after two weeks of 
very hard labor we gave 
up.  However we did 
find more signs of 
Dinohyus in this cut than 
at any time before. 
  On September 1st 
Carl Sorensen and I were 
left alone, the boys we had 
employed began work 
on a Diceratherium slab 
for their colleges. 
  Sorensen and I then set to 
prospecting the 
Upper Harrison beds.  After our 
first weeks work 
of hard searching we 
secured only one specimen 
worth taking.  This was a 
very small Deer 
(Blastomeryx) apparently fore 
and hind limbs are 
present.  Fragments of skull 
with lower jaws + pelvis, 
part of a small turtle is 
also in this block. 
  After another two weeks of 
prospecting we found 
but very little material 
worth taking.  Even Merychyus 
and Promerycochoerus 
are not as common as 
expected.  We secured one 
skull and jaws of 
Merychyus that are very good.  
A badly messed up 
Parahippus ? Oxydactylus 
fore and hind limb 
bones.  Jaws and pelvis and 
possibly some limb 
bones of a second Blastomeryx.  
Frag'y skull and 
jaws of a Camel.  also Dinohyus 
teeth.  ???Probascidian. 
  Miller discovered a very fair 
Dinohyus skull 
in the Lower Harrison Beds 
about 3 mi East of 
Agate.  This was found at 
apparently a lower level 
than the old Agate Spring Quarry. 
  From the quarry we secured a 
complete set of 
Diceratherium cervicals 
(that was from the old cut) 
Two Moropus femora was 
all we saved from the 
new cut.
