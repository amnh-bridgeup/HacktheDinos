The beds on Wounded Knee above Manderson 
do not show any break in sedimentation 
but are apparently continuous, changing 
gradually from a sandy clay full of 
small round concretions 
(Leptauchenia beds) to a 
soft clayey sand full of irregular 
concretions 
in some layers, and in upper part harder 
limy layers. 
   In Leptauchenia beds occurred numerous 
Leptauchenia and an Oreodont about size 
of Eporeodon, + fragments of Leptomeryx, 
horse + carnivore + Steneofiber. 
The base of 
Rosebud beds was determined by fauna only, 
as no break occurs, but Leptauchenia 
fauna disappears + Ticholepteos is found. 
Higher up occurred the Merycochoerus skulls 
which are probably (some of them at least) 
Promerycochoeus.  Upper levels of Rosebud 
beds are very barren. Cosonyx occurs, +c. 
Contact between Rosebud + Loup Fork not 
Well shown on this creek.
