  We had intended prospecting the 
Goshen Hole country this season 
but on spending a few days in the 
Sheep + Snake Creek beds we decided 
to remain and work them another 
season.  What changed our plans 
was Dr. O. Abel, Univ. of Vienna. 
visited our camp early in the 
 season and while visiting the 
Olcott Hill Hesperopithecus locality 
he picked up what was supposed 
to be a second Hesperopithecus 
tooth, though this locality was 
in Mr. Ashbrook's pasture where 
we had been refused permission 
to work.  So we decided to look 
for a new prospect in the same beds.
