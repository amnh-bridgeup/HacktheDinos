Creek Quarry was about 10 ft.below A+B. 
and Sinclair Draw.  Quarry C was 
in the upper beds about 20 feet above 
these and the fauna was somewhat 
different and perhaps a little later 
in formation. 
  On a whole our Expedition this 
year was a great success.  Securing 
many new and interesting things, 
also many skulls of animals known 
hitherto from small scraps of jaws etc. 
  We secured nine fair sized boxes 
of material weighing,Total weight 1400# 
  We obtained several Carnivore skulls 
Horse, Camel, Bovid, Oreodont, Turtle, 
Fish and Alligator skulls. one or 
more of each. 
  A new Reo Speed Wagon was 
added to our camp equipment this 
year, which proved invaluable to 
a field party of Bone Diggers. 
Enabling us to carry our full camp 
equipment.
