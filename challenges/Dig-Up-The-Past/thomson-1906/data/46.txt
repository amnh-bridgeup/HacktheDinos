  June 15th we began work in the Snake 
and Sheep Creek quarries 
where we left off in 
1923.  We worked these quarries until 
August 4th with about the usual result.
Material scrappy, though 
we succeeded in securing 
some new materials. ? 
One skull and jaws in 
position of Pilanchenia 
from the upper Snake 
Creek beds and a very 
good Dog skull from the 
Sheep Creek beds were 
about our best finds. 
  August 9th we worked 
a new Stenomylus 
quarry which we discovered 
about 125 yards 
to the north of the old 
Amherst Hill Quarry. 
  We secured three 
skeletons with skulls and 
three incomplete skeletons, 
alphabetically arranged 
A,B,C,D,E +F.  This quarry we 
called the Amer. 
Mus. Quarry.  If team and 
scraper was used 
for a week on this new 
Stenomylus quarry I am 
quite certain more skeletons can be had 
 We ran over to the Snake and Sheep Crk 
beds from time to time 
during August while 
Paul Miller was with us.  
While doing this Miller 
and myself discovered 
in the very uppermost 
Sheep Creek beds a very small 
pocket containing 
two Merychippus skulls of 
the larger type and several 
jaws and a fair skull of Oreodont.  
Also some Deer 
fragments.  Also part skeleton 
of Alticaruelus.  Lower Snake Crk. 
  August 15th we opened 
the Agate Spring Quarry 
to the south east of the 
old cut where the 
stripping was not as heavy 
as at the old cut.
