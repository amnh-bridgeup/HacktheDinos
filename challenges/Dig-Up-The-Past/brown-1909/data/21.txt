Judith River Beds of Alberta Can.

Exposures examined are on Red Deer River 80 miles east of Calgary near J.L. Wagner ranch  at mouth of Michichee Creek where beds are 300? feet thick. They are said to extend about 50 miles each way on Red Deer. This is a plains deposit and beds for most part are horizontal though strata seldom continue uninterruptedly for any considerable distance. There is less sand than in beds of same age farther south in States Light, almost white beds of soft sandstone give the beds a mottled appearance and these beds occur as lenses frequently underlain by coal seams. Laminated sandstone occurs as local beds and one seam appears to be fairly constant but the large rounded irregular brown sandstone concretions that are so frequent in these beds in U.S. are entirely absent.
