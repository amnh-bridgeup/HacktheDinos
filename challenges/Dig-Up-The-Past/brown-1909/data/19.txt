Notes 25 graves of peculiar construction near Arvilla North Dakota seven feet deep in solid gravel six to seven feet across circular in shape and all filled with black loam. Indraws buried in sitting posture and from 2 to 7 in each grave apparently entire family buried together.
No flints were found in graves except one stone used to sharpen knives. All implements were made from ivory not bone and most ivory had red streaks running through it. Implements were knives spears and skinning took all with notched edges.
Near by on ridge are graves of modern Indians with stone implements probably Chippewas.
