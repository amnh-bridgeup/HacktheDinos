Section 4 miles East of C.K. ranch
Whole thickness of Laramie about 250 feet capped by light colored dry layer 4 ft thick over which is 2 ft dark lignitic clay as west on Big Dry + tributaries. In some places however the lower lignites of the Ft. Union are absent and the massive buff  colored sandstone of the upper Ft. union lies unconformably on the Laramie Cross bedding is a very pronounced feature of all the Laramie on the eastern exposure.
The three members are present over most of the area but the basal [unreadable] is of less thickness than farther west not more than 30 ft all told. 
	Glacial drift is more abundant on the east making the proper eating very difficult. Limestone is much more abundant in the eastern drift and boulders are numerous. At Frazer the drift is sorted gravel several Basal sandstone not exposed

feet thick with few boulders and is excavated by the G.N.P.R. for ballast. 
	On the east the Laramie gradually thins out from the plain and the exposures are confined to the lower reaches of the streams. The most eastern bad lands were seen along the river on the east of Sheep Creek.
	At Warrens ranch on Remuda Creek the upper and middle sandstone are highly crossbedded and contain a great deal of limonite covered pebbles with many dinosaur bones badly washed and broken. More fragments were seen here than at any other point.
