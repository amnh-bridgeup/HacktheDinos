Water and Wells Alberta
Along the lives of C.P.R. from Maclewd to Edmonton water is usually hard though palatable to taste. Soft water sometimes ontained in deep wells. On plains west of Red Deer few wells have been drilled but water obtained in nearly every case and usually soft; always good.
	Well drillers at work on side hill farm 6 miles N.W. Carbon had drilled 140 ft. and had not struck water but said usually struck it at 100 ft. and less.
	90 cts. is cost for first 100 ft. $1.25 up to two hundred feet. All wells are cased and cost is 25 cts. per ft.
