Notes on Judith River U.S.
East of Glasgow first bad lands crop out on south side of railroad at Vandala but escarpments are nearly all grass covered. Concretions appear in places and exposures are about 60 feet thick as seen from the railroad. The strata thicken slightly to westward apparently and are exposed better at Hinsdale where they are about 100 ft thick. They extend from 5 miles west of the Hinsdale to the first large creek joining the Milk River from the south. This exposure west of Hinsdale is probably 25 miles long. From there west to Havre there are no exposures on the south of road. On north side of road there is only one small exposure about four station east of Havre.
	Formation is uniformly light colored, much lighter than

the Laramie composed chiefly of clays and sand and all are much faulted and cross bedded with some large concretions resembling those in the Laramie.
	Four miles west of Havre the Milk cuts through fine exposures which are not more than 50 feet as exposed. These rocks seem composed chiefly of finely sorted, very compact soft sandstone which is much harder than anything in the Laramie. All beds are highly cross-bedded more so than in the Laramie and contain considerable carbonated material. Heavy beds of finely stratified shales are intercalated in places and contains at base where overlies sandstone many fragmentary bones. Trachodon Monoclomius, Dryptosaurus, Champsosaurus, Lamva, Lepedosteou, Adocus, Crododile, and plate of new dinosaur were
