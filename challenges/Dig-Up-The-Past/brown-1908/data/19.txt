Last night Bessie Willis and Ed rode into camp about six bringing letters and Scribned May for me and letters for Pete. We went over to the quarry and they saw the excavation and a few bones enough to satisfy their curiosity. 
	During the night a heavy storm broke and rained nearly all night. The Creek was running full all day. About nine o'clock we went to work and during the day finished our excavation.

Pete and I worked in the quarry all day and uncovered nearly all the vertebral column which is in position. Found the skull and jaws separate near the pelvis.
	Johnson took the team and went after water and wood. Got bogged in the Dry, had to hitch Dick onto Blue to pull him out and then dug the wagon out but got home about seven o'clock with a barrel of water load of wood and sack of potatoes.
	Big round up passed his morning toward Maguire Creek but Billy pulled up the sage bush to which he was tied so I could not go after meat. Horses came back in the evening.
	Beautiful sunset. Took a color photograph.
