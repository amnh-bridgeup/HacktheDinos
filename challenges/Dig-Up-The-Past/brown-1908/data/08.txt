Started for Tritchell's on east side of Dry and looked out bad lands all the way. No bones were found in sand stone although it looked favorable. Stopped for dinner at Edward's sheep pens and found a good prospect within half mile located in Clay probably a Triceratops. This was opposite to and about three miles from other specimen on east side. We will camp as this place near the sheep pen where there is a fine spring of water. Made camp about five o'clock and found the boys just back. Everything was all right and just as we had left it two years ago. No mail. Pete had about 25-lbs. of Ankylo. fragments. They had lost their road twice.
Found a fine bunch of fossil figs today.

Couldn't go to church so did a two weeks wash and cleaned up in morning. All were invited to dinner by Mrs. Twitchell. 
Bessie Willis and one of their men rode in for dinner and we had a lively time. Bessie is belle of the Dry and a lovely lass. 
We planned for a celebration here on the fourth of July. I am to make the Welsh Rarebit and she makes the candy. Music is to be furnish by the phonograph. After dinner Pete and I walked about a mile east and took pictures of some fine looking sandstone. Came back and developed the color pictures but all turned out n.g. Found out later that I had reversed the plates. In morning we had some bucking broncho exhibitions and I took several pictures of Kirk Stanley riding.
