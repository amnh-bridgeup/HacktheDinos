The wagon and Pete moved on down to Twitchell's ranch and I rode out all the lower sandstone on the head of the two streams above the cabin. Found one skeleton running into clay and sandstone concretions but bones were in poor condition; saw nothing worth taking. At noon rode into Twitchells ranch and met Mrs. Twitchell. Her husband was not at home. The two little boys have grown considerable. One is three Billy and 		is		
	Boy [?] camped between the house and the Creek, a very pretty spot among the trees. With three tents up it looks like quite a settlement. Mrs. T. [?] was very glad to see us. She sent down cream and milk by the little boys and I spent the evening at the house. The youngest sister is now married.

Rose through bad lands between Twitchell's + Davis's but found bad lands quite barren. Mostly upper sandstone level with good many Triceratops bones in clay below.
