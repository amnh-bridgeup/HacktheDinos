Rode down the Dry this morning to locate our new camp. Found two find springs near the two square topped buttes on this side of the Dry which are our land marks but grass is rather short and would have to cross the Dry to work new sandstone specimen. Found Tyrannosaurus lower jaw and back of skull near one of buttes, will take it. Tried to cross creek several times but always mired in quicksand. At last found a herd of cattle and put them through I following after. This was the hottest day of the year so far. Brownie was dripping wet on a walk or slow trot. The heat near the bad lands was almost unbearable. Horse and I were both completely played out when we reached camp. Finally decided to camp at specimen and use creek water. Pete loaded wagon; boxed fossils.

I took pictures of the party in the afternoon and promised to
