June 8th, 1908
Left Miles City about 3:30 P.M. 
after spending Friday, Saturday, 
and Sunday there.
Had considerable difficulty in having a cook; finally engaged a man by name of C.H. Lambert an old ex cowpuncher at $50. per month. Also had trouble in getting a saddle pony. Never saw horses as high or as scarce especially in one of the first horse markets of the world. Found roads on Sunday Creek very soft and spongy and muddy in places. Camped about 2 miles beyond the 6 mile bridge.

June 9th
Found roads still very soft. Passed Mr. + Mrs. Roberts on road yesterday but did not recognize them, then met Gov. Roberts and wife and talked with them some time. They now run the 21 mile road
