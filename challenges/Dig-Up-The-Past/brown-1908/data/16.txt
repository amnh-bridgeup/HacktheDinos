Claude Willis hooked on a lead team and pulled us through the Dry quicksand up onto Rock Creek and then I piloted the outfit through the hills to the specimen. Could hardly sit on my horse till we pulled into camp. In afternoon I staid under the wagon while Pete and Johnson put up tents and put things in shipshape. Have a delightful place with plenty of grass about 200 yards from the quarry.
This new specimen is about 1 1/4 miles from the Big Dry on the east side 25 miles from the Missouri River located in soft sand with sandstone concretions and clay pellets surrounding the bones.

Johnson and I took team and wagon back to Willis for plow scraper and water barrel, have found that the water hole is pretty strong of alkali. Took three hours over and four back so we spend the whole day, but brought a load of wood as well. 
Pete worked all day breaking a big rock which lies where we want to make the cut.
