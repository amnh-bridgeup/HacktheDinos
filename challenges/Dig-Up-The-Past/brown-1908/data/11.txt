This morning I decided to send Lambert after mail for Mr. Twitchell came home yesterday and said he would stake me to a horse for the ride. While writing letters Lambert came to tent and said he thought his work wasn't satisfactory and he was too light for the job any way and he had a change to go to miles with Mr. Rogers so he would quit. He wasn't half as pleased as I was so we were both satisfied. He was one of the greatest gass bags I ever hired. Two men quit Twitchell today and I engaged the best one a Norewegian by name of Johnson. Nilo come to work when he guest to Glasgow for his bed. Pito worked on Triceratops scapula in afternoon and I rode again on Love Tree Creek. Saw a skeleton in sandstone and two sana but n.g.

Sunday June 28th
Rode out with Pete in morning and took up scapula and coracoid, he came back to camp and I rode on Lone Tree again till one o'clock. Wind blew a regular gale all day. Didn't see many bones. Some one brought in mail yesterday and I had my first letters in three weeks. 
	Sunday afternoon took it easy as possible and tried to be clean and Godly.
