This morning arise early and had an early breakfast in order to get a long days work. Mrs. Crawford's 6 mo old baby was sick all night however and everybody was up at Twitchells all night so no one went after the horses till 8:30. Then our horses were not in the bunch and I had to go after them. Got started at 10 and reached the Triceratops specimen down the Dry about 12 o'clock. On the road "Bones" met us with several letters + package of pictures and papers. 
	T-specimen turned out several ribs ibrium and some unidentified bones running into clay. Will have to prospect it further from a camp below.

Rode down Dry on east side this morning and had been out only a short while when it began a slow rain. Prospected till nearly one o'clock finding many bones in ironstone clay concretions but by that time the clays were running water and footing precarious so we started home. 
	On road came across a two year old beef steer that had been killed about three days. Part of meat was gone so we concluded it furnished the "deer" meat that Johnson gave us at Twitchells. Rained part of afternoon so we read papers and wrote letters.
