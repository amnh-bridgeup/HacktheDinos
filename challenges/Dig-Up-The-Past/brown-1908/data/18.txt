July 11th
Put in five effective shots this morning and finished taking the dirt off about 20 feet of the skeleton if it is connected. Struck ribs coming up into sand in three places. Will put in one more day of removing top dirt before we begin to prospect around the bone. This was a still very hot forenoon so we did nearly a days work in the morning and Pete and I took a half holiday in afternoon riding over to Rock Creek to pick currants. Found them about half ripe. Picked a gallon while a swarm of mosquitoes took tolo. Had a delightful bath in Rock Creek after which I felt civilized once more.

Sunday July 12th
Couldn't go to church so did a big wash after having swept my tent and aired bed. 
	Johnson boiled down the currants and made four jars of jelly two for us to take home. He baked bread in afternoon while we read and wrote. Dug a water hole in bed of stream after lunch finding a god stream of water but thoroughly alkalied. 
	Expected visitors from Willis ranch today but no one came.
