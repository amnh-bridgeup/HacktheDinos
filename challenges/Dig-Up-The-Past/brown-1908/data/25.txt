  Sunday Aug. 2nd
Got up at 4:30 and telephoned up to Mrs. Bonebards to get them all started. I had a row with the night clerk at the hotel who refused to take my personal check but took it nevertheless. Had fruit and a vile cup of coffee and was in the saddle at 6. Did not overtake team till we reached the ferry where we we all waited and fished in the Missouri. I caught the only fish a little cat. 
	We all ate lunch in the old saloon at Mr. Ganus ferry and then crossed the river. Rode with the Willis' five miles and then took to the hills on old Brownie. After going some eight miles came to small stream with fine clear water holes; found a fence and then a dug out with hay stack. There was nothing to eat but rice and tea but that looked good so I camped.

Aug. 3rd
There was a cat at the shanty that was tickled to death to see me and stood on my breast all night to keep her feet warm. No one had been there since April and she had the floor strewn with sage hew, lark, and black bird feathers. It was cold last night and my saddle blankets felt thin. Rode through several miles of marine beds and found the hills capped with basal sandstone of the Laramie with possibly some Fox Hills but saw no bones all day. On the ridges there was five grass and more cattle than I have seen altogether during the year. The bad lands on Sand Arroyo looked most promising for bones. Rode about 35 miles today and Brownie was about all in. Reached camp about five oÂ¹clock. The outfit and Mason reached there about noon. Pete has been taking up ribs during the entire time we were gone.
