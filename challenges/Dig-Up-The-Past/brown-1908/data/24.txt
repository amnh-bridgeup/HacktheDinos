August 1st
Tried to find a man all morning and at last Mr. Davenport of the Truecolt Co. introduced me to a man by name of Mazon who was working in the warehouse. I hired him and we hitched up the team and loaded the wagon before noon expecting to start about 3 o'clock. At 1 o'clock the thermometers in town ranged from 101 to 108 while a clinic thermometer registered 103 1/2. A hot wind blew constantly. At 3 o'clock it was 111 at the ferry. This was the hottest day I ever saw in Montana. A hot wind blew until eleven at night. Started the team out after supper and I went down and had supper with Bessie Willis' Uncle and Aunt.
