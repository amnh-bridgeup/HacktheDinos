Rode out west in big pasture this morning and found many bones, mostly Triceratops but few ran into the banks. In afternoon found several bones running into a heavy sandstone. Bone is well preserved.

June 23rd
Pete and I rode over to sandstone specimen and developed it enough to find tat the rock above will have to be shot off. The bones turn out to be Trachodon but we will shoot some of the rock off in hopes of finding a skull. Will ride down to Mr. Willis' in morning and have him order a drill for me.
	Pete and I walked over this morning and I could not find the specimen till I came back to the ranch and got a saddle horse, then found it without any trouble.

Got up at 3:30 had breakfast and was on the trail at 4:30, fine morning, cool with dew everywhere and lots of cattle feeding in the valley of the Dry Heard coyotes singing for the first time this year and saw one. Reached Mr. Willis at 630 15 miles from Tritchell's. They had just eaten breakfast. Sent letters and ordered things and borrowed a drill from Mr. Willis then gave Brownie an hours rest he was pretty tired after his first two hours work. Rode back toward clay specimen and prospected on the road. Picked up bones in wash for an hour discovering that this is Triceratops then rode up to Edward's sheep shearing camp where I had lunch. Did not leave till 2:30 so hot. One of the men has a pet wolf. Pete and Lambert worked on Trachodon.
