Rode down to Davis horse ranch this morning looking out all bad lands on west side of Dry. Found a few bones but nothing of value. Davis was starting his ranch two years ago when I stopped there. The old ~x (hat x) ranch on Timber Creek is about a mile above Davis' place. George Sudlow owns the old hat x ranch a young man about 30 who is said to be worth 2_ millions. Spend his summer out here in the bad lands. 
	Rained today quite hard about 3 o'clock, the first rain on us this season.

Broke camp and started at seven o'clock to pull down to Twitchells. Met Mr. Davis on the road herding his band of horses and he directed us how to miss two bad crossings below his ranch by going around through the bad lands about 2 miles further. We pulled out at least 8 miles out of our road and camped at an old abandoned sheep cabin near an alkali spring about 130. In the afternoon Pete and I rode down the creek looking out the bad lands but discovered nothing worth taking. Met two Italian peddlers who wanted to sell us something.
