Pete and Lambert took wagon and Billy and went over to Vialls for stove and mess box also to prospect Ankylosaurus quarry for more fragments. Cloudy and rain most of the morning. I rode down the creek to relocate fossil found two years ago going on the west side side of Dry all the way. Passed two sheep outfits belonging to Edwards. At mouth of Box Cr. came to Mr. Willis's sheep pens where they were shearing sheep. Rode in half mile and met Mr. Willis with one of the shepherd. He did not recognize me at first. We went on over to the house and were just in time for dinner. Met Mrs. Willis their son Claude and daughter Bessie for the first time. Did not ride after dinner but turned horse in pasture and talked.

Bessie made sinkers for breakfast as they were jokingly called and I borrowed one of their old horses and started up the Dry on the east side for the specimen. Bogged down in the quicksand in mid stream, the old horse going down to the saddleskirts. Had to get off in mid stream and then the old fellow floundered out. Rode up above mouth of Box Creek a half mile and crossed over island. Followed up east side past Rock Creek through sand dunes examining concretions all the way and discovered specimen about four and a half miles above Mr. Willis's. Examined the specimen more carefully and think it a mixed quarry. There were four long limb bones showing. Spend the night at Mr. Willis's.
