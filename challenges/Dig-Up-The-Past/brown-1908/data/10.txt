Went over to quarry in morning with Pete and blew off about 2 tons of rock in two shots. Boys did not move much rock yesterday. Lambert thought it was terribly hard work he told Pete and said he knew something was wrong with this outfit for Friel wouldn't tell him anything about us. In afternoon had Lambert go with us. He was sullen but didn't have anything to say. Put in one shot and moved nearly three tons of rock uncovering another tibia and fibula but no skull. This was a terribly warm day. The grass will soon burn up dry at this rate.

Sent Pete and Lambert to quarry and I rode through pasture in morning finding four skulls of Triceratops probably a different genus but none worth taking. There was a regular pocket of bones in this locality; saw besides skulls several limb bones partly broken and nearly a dozen ribs. All either in lower concretionary sandstone layer above the basal sandstone or else in clay.
	In afternoon went with Pete and decided to abandon Trachodon quarry plastering the bones and covering them up for future reference. There were two ischia middle metatarsal, metacarpal, both tibiae and one fibula showing and there are undoubtly more under this massive sandstone. Went over to some clay prospects and found that Triceratops skull was n.g. but scapula and coracoid were good.
