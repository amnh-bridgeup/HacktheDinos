July 17th
Rode slowly to camp and prospected up Rock Creek. Didn't find any bones. Cloudy and showers all morning and afternoon. Reached camp about noon. Pete has bared nearly the whole vertebral column of the Tyrannosaurus skeleton. Rode out bad lands north of camp near hawk nest in afternoon but found very few frags.

Rode up creek this morning and found part of little Predentate skeleton in carbonaceous clay just above basal sandstone also ornithomimus metalarsals and a slope covered with pine cones. Gathered nearly a quart of cones. In afternoon uncovered little specimen and found femur tibia and about 20 vertebrae. This

is a poor shape specimen but the best of its kind that we have. Embedded all round it were five lead impressions many of which I own save for identifications. One Gingko leaf was preserved like a piece of rubber. I never saw a leaf preserved like this before, usually only the impression. Pete has dug around the skeleton and found tons of rock on the lower side. The skull and lower jaws are apparently complete.

Sunday July 19th
Washed clothes and rested all day. Bessie and a Mr. Cole rode over and brought mail, staid for dinner and supper. We walked over to quarries and they were much impressed with big dinosaur. Afterwards, I took them over the hills collecting.
