Today I finished taking out the little dinosaur and found some good leaves with it. Pete is working to separate the lower jaws from the skull.

In morning took chisel to sharpen and rode to Willis ranch looked out bad lands on way. 
	Bessie was giving me a party and had fried chicken and ice cream. Johnson was to follow with wagon and we were going across the Missouri to get it fixed. Found Ed Thomas just ready to go back to Glasgow so he took the tongue of out wagon and promised to get the provisions for us. We staid till after supper when Johnson borrowed their Spring wagon to haul our beds home in and I staid to pick some garden truck

We both got back to camp about eleven o'clock. It was still light enough to see the trail most of the way. 
	All the people in the neighborhood are having a hard time to cross the river this year on account of cutting the bank during the high water. We will probably have a hard time hauling in the bones but Claud Willis says they may be able to help us.

Finished riding out the bad lands as far as the south side of Rock Creek today but did not find any bones to speak of. Saw the tracks of a doe and little fawn about three miles above camp on the head of this creek. Found bones higher than I have ever found them before very close to the Ft. Union but still in the Laramie. This was one of the hot days
