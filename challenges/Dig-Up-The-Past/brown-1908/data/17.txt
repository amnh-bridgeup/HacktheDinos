Scraped and plowed all the fore noon laid off till four and worked till seven a schedule we shall follow while using the team. Started a big cut 80 feet long and 15 wide up to the high bank. Moved lots of dirt today. Wind blew from the west and was hot, making grass curl.

July 9th
Today was a repetition of yesterday hot wind and all but wind was strong blowing down out cook tent. We drink so much water that it would make one sick to use the creek water. The hill diminished rapidly today.

July 10th
Worked with the team in the morning but struck a large area in the center that we could not plow so scraped and plowed the ends of quarry which are sandy clay and left the clay center. Began shooting the face off. Send Johnson over to borrow Willis' drill in afternoon as ours is too short, he took Billy and nearly used him up it was so warm, must have ridden somewhere else.
