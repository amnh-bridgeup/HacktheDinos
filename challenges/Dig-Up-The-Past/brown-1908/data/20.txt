Took Brownie and started after round up. Went south two miles and then saw a herd of cattle driven toward Box Creek on the side of the Dry. Crossed over and followed finding the wagons down at the mouth of Box Creek. There were two outfits the C.K. and X.I.T. The gave me about 20 lbs. of meat. One legged Sensiba was with the C.K. wagon ate dinner with them and Mr. Willis came in about noon. After dinner they worked the herd in the sand hills on the east side of the Dry cutting out and branding the calves. There were about 1000 head of cattle.

Rode Billy over to Willis to sharpen picks and chisels. Took till three o'clock to finish on account of leaky bellows. Wrote some letters and had just finished when it began to rain hard. The horses got out of the corral and old Billy ran with the reins under his feet. I got soaking wet before I captured him. Decided to wait till after supper before starting to camp so Bessie and I rode down to the garden to get some onions and lettuce. While there it began raining again and we raced back to the house. After supper it looked like rain again so I decided to stay all night. Played whist till eleven o'clock. Today while riding over climbed to top of high peak and photographed young hawks. Found it not so hard going up but very difficult coming down.
