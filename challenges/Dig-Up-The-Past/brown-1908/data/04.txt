We took a wrong road once and had to go back a mile in order to cross the Big Dry at the mouth of the Little Dry. Passed Wilbur Titus herding a band of sheep because the herder had left he said. He was just as dirty as ever. Shortly after leaving Titus we crossed a narrow deep wash out and the end of the tongue came up against the ax handle which rested on the irons of the axle-tree and splintered one side. Since that we have pulled through some very bad holes and it still holds together so I hope it will hold till we get to a town. Passed the first Laramie rocks three miles above Gruells old place and camped opposite the Gruell ranch site about 3 o'clock. Wind blew a gale all day: sand came like dust. Will rise over the old pasture

tomorrow and try to find the skeleton that Gruell discovered several years ago.

June 13th
Rode all through the bad lands on Flat Creek around the Gruell pasture and found several bones mostly Triceratops but nothing worth collecting. The ranch buildings have been torn down and the pasture sold to some one else. 
	This morning the horses took fright while eating their oats and all ran away with nose bags on. Borrowed a shepherds horse and found them two miles up the river at another sheep camp where a man had caught them. 
Art Viall has a sheep shearing pen just below our camp. They brought in one letter for Pete today but none for me.
