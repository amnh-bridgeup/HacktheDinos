Worked in the quarry a short time and then hitched up to the team and went to Willis' for water. They were very much surprised for I told Bessie I should be gone three or four days so she piloted Mason to camp yesterday. The spring was so low that I wouldn't take water from the house spring and filled the barrel at Rock Creek.
