send prints if they came out well. In the evening we put up a swing and had an early supper after which dancing began in earnest. The children dropped off to sleep one by one and were stored on the beds and floor of the third room. There were not enough beds for all the women so I brought most of mine up from the camp while I took the horse blankets and extra tarp. I danced till twelve finding some very good partners and one bad one. Some of the people danced all night till seven o'clock Sunday morning then had breakfast and drove to their homes. Tried to find Marippa lilies for a color picture today but nearly all wild flowers have gone.

July 5th Sunday
Finished loading wagon and started for our new camp about ten o'clock in morning. Camped for noon at spring near Triceratops quarry about seven miles from Twitchells. Rode ahead of outfit and looked and looked out a few prongs of Box Creek. 
Johnson joined us this morning as the new cook and teamster. Camped at Willis' place tonight. Mrs. Willis invited us to eat at the house so we did not make a regular camp but unloaded part of every plaster and vats so we could pull load to our new camp across the Fry about six miles. Saw a perfect rainbow in the east, about nine o'clock it lacked the brilliant colors of one seen by daylight. Slept at the house but was sick nearly all night, sick headache.
