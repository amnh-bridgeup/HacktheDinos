Pete and I rode down the Dry slowly as far as the specimen found two years ago. Got there about noon and prospected it before lunch finding that there were three Trachodon femora belonging to two individuals of different sizes. Decided not to take any of this material. On the road home I found another specimen running into soft sand. Uncovered 13-caudal vertebrae and saw more bones running into sand. Cannot place this animal. The vertebrae are somewhat crushed laterally but are too long for either Trachodon or Triceratops.

Worked on new sandstone specimen today making a six foot cut in soft sand and clay. Found bones in concretions everywhere on that level. Will move camp down near there and work that specimen out first.
	Coming home tried to find a crossing over the Dry but Brownie bogged down every time that I tried it. Bessie Willis came up today to help Mrs. Twitchell get ready for the celebration on the Fourth.
