due to slip.  The lay of the 
	beds is very irregular; to what 
	extent this is due to slipping 
	I could not say. 
June 26.	Fish remains are the 
	most abundant thing in the 
	Niobrara; they belong to large 
	or medium sized species only, 
	so far as known.  Many ostreid 
	shells, and some large shells. 
	The saurian remains are 
	rarer, the turtle + pterodactyl 
	still more rare; birds we have 
	not seen.  The Pierre lies to 
	West of camp as well as 
	East.  In western exposue 
	we found Clidastes vertebrae 
	+ a lage ?Aucodus, same as 
	specimen found in eastern 
	bluffs.  It was so badly  
	preserved that we left it 
	at camp.
