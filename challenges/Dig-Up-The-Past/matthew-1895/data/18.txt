dactyl etc. ? These layers ae 
yellow chalk with soft and 
hard layers moe or less 
alternating, and with spots 
and streaks of blue chalk. 
Below this comes the blue 
chalk with turtle, pterodactyl, 
Portheus + Aucodus, most 
abundant near the top.  This 
blue chalk is exposed for a 
thickness of twenty or thirty 
feet.  It is in large part a 
shale, as far as structure 
goes; is somewhat softer 
and weathers more easily 
than the yellow, but does 
not cut as well and fossils 
are not so well preserved 
in it.  Hardens on exposure. 
The yellow chalk aso hardens 
somewhat; not over ten feet of 
it is exposed at no. 11 locality.
