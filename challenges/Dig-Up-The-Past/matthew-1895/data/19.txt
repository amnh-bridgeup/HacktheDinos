July 2-3	Went up to Oakley to get 
	lumber + var's smaller things 
July 5		Worked on boxes + packed 
July 6		Hell Crk ? Worked down 
	 the stream to below Howell's 
	house + camped near a spring 
	Â½ m. below it.  The beds are 
	rather different from Black 
	Hills outcrop, do not show 
	the same uniformity in the 
	blue beds, which are always 
	capped with yellow, but often 
	alternated with ditto and may 
	in part correspond to the upper 
	beds of that area.  Top layers 
	of yellow chalk are cherty 
	in seams.  Fault opposite 
	to camp, apparently slip both 
	ways, this
