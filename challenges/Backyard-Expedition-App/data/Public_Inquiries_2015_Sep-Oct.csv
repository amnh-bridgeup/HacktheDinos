Hello again Mr. Mehling!
I usually contact you with my fossil finds, but I came across a rather large bone that is hard to identify, is there a person at the museum I could contact about identifying that? 
Unfortunately the last identification day was during my finals and I could not make it, is there any coming up?
As always, thank you for your time,

This is that weird bone that was found on the beach in NJ that I have been unable to identify. If you have any insight I would greatly appreciate it! Sorry if the ruler is hard to see, it is a 16 inch ruler and the bone is about 14 inches long.

Hi Courtney,
Thanks for your email. You found some fun things there. 
The first one (the two impressions in rock) is a bit hard to read but at least one impression is a brachiopod. It seems to be a spiny productid brachiopod: those tiny pits represent the molds of the spines which will extend into the rock. Compare it to this: https://woostergeologists.scotblogs.wooster.edu/2014/07/18/woosters-fossils-of-the-week-silicified-productid-brachiopods-from-the-permian-of-west-texas/. The other impression seems to be a mold of a shell or a coral - hard to say.   
The second (the ribbed cylinders) appear to be some kind of coral, maybe something like Syringopora.
The last one (like a flower) is probably a horn coral.
All of these animals were common in the Devonian Period (~354-409 million years ago) and there is certainly a lot of Devonian rock upstate, so that is my best guess. Nice finds!
Best, Carl

Hi Brian,
Thanks for your email. I feel pretty sure that you have a fossil nautiloid there, maybe a straight-shelled one. Nautiloids have chambered shells and what you have is several chambers that filled with sediment (which later turned to stone) and outlasted the shell. You can see a few great examples for comparison here: http://www.nautiloid.net/fossils/cephalopod/naut1/naut1.html. If yours is straight-shelled it is between ~210 & 520 million years old. Because it came from landscape rock it could be difficult to find its original source rock for more accurate aging. Nice find!

Well, the pix came through fine this time but they are pretty fuzzy. But also, the tooth is pretty beat up. I don’t see serrations, which would pretty much clinch it as a meat-eating dinosaur tooth. But there is one group found in Africa, the spinosaurids, that lack serrations. It could be one of those but it just as easily could be a crocodilian tooth. I’m not sure there’s enough to go on here.
Sorry!

Well, it appears that, (according to this geologic map, anyways) that Terrell County where the site the item was found is located, is firmly planted in the Cretaceous period. 
From my 5 years here on the forum, it seems that most unknowns from Texas are usually either Bison, or Rudists.      
I think we can rule out Bison on this one!   
Hopefully we can get a better ID once some of our Texas members weigh in.

So, if the layers are Cretaceous I'll say just geologic...However, let the experts in Texas's fossils tell their opinion.

Hi Lauren,
Thanks for your email. I see you also posted this to the Fossil Forum: they are a superb group. And I will have to agree with the ones that IDed at least your first photos as a rudist. Rudists are relatives of clams that formed huge reefs and went extinct in the Cretaceous. As mentioned, TX has a good amount of Cretaceous exposures so yours is likely one of the last rudists. Nice find! As for the other rock, I am not sure if that is a fossil (maybe another rudist) or just a geological oddity. Sorry.

Thanks for your email. What you have is a clam steinkern. Steinkerns are the sediment that fills a void (in this case the inside of a dead clam shell) and later turns to stone. This often outlasts the shell, which seems to be the case with yours. The FL Gulf fossils are all fairly young so yours is probably a few million years old. Nice find!

Hi Jason,
Thanks for your email. You can tell your son that he is the lucky finder of a fossil horn coral. Horn corals were solitary corals that lived on Earth from the Ordovician to the Permian (as old as ~500 million years and as young as 250). By comparison the oldest known dinosaurs are about 245 million years old. Stone Harbor is very far from any likely sources of a fossil like this so this was probably brought there by ocean currents or rivers, and, maybe if it came from northern NJ or even southern NY, glaciers might have also contributed to its movements. It holds a long and complex story so it should be looked at with wonder! Nice find!

Hi Chris,
Thanks for your email. What you have here is an oyster shell, probably from the species Crassostrea. The neatly partitioned groove in the last three photos is the hinge of the oyster. The holes riddling the shell are from a sponge called Cliona that excavated galleries in the shell of the dead oyster and then used the oyster shell as its home for a while. It’s probably modern but I can’t rule out fossil. Fossils merely need to be 10,000 or more years old to be fossils and one that old could certainly look like this. There’s no easy way to tell.

Hi Carl,
Thankyou for IDing the straight shelled nautiloid. I had no idea what it was. I do have another fossil that I was wondering if it is the tip of a straight shelled nautiloid shell. At first I thought it was a tooth but then it looked more like a snail shell, so not sure but if it is a nautiloid or just the way some rock formed. I'll be thrilled to find out.
On the left side of the 2nd photo is what I think is a shell but not sure. I know it doesn't show very well in the photo, but I was curious if you know what it is, and the fossil on the right too I am not sure if it is a shell or a water bug of some kind.
I'm thinking that the fossils on the right side and left side are the same type of creature. If you can't tell what it is that's fine,
I'm really mainly curious about what the rock in the middle is.
That's it for me. I'm out of fossils.
Thanks for inspiring me.
Ray

Hi James and Ray,
Thanks for your email. I do agree that this is a fossil but it is very beat up and a bit hard to confidently ID. That said, I still feel reasonably sure it is a straight-shelled nautiloid. Nautiloids are still with us today but were incredible common and diverse in the Paleozoic (~530-250 million years ago). The straight-shelled ones persisted a bit into the Mesozoic (until around 210 million years ago). I don’t know enough about the rocks near Georgian Bay to give a better idea of this thing’s age but suffice it to say that if I’ve IDed it correctly it’s 100s of millions of years old and at least as old as the oldest known dinosaur. Nice find!

Hi Ray,
In the photo of the trio, I think the one on the left is a brachiopod, but it’s quite weathered, making the ID difficult. The conical one in the center is most likely a horn coral. Horn corals were solitary corals that lived on Earth from the Ordovician to the Permian (as old as ~500 million years and as young as 250). By comparison the oldest known dinosaurs are about 245 million years old. And I agree that the last one is also a fossil but that one is giving me the most trouble. It could be a brachiopod, like you suggest, but it could be a bunch of other things, too. Sorry about that one!

Hi Rosa,
Thanks for your email. The photos are a bit fuzzy so I’m having a little trouble making out the detail. I think I’m supposed to be looking at the fine, mesh-like pattern, yes? If so it looks like a bryozoan, which is a colonial aquatic animal. But it appears to be flaking off the rock. If this is the case it is more likely to be a modern bryozoan attached to the rock rather than a fossil bryozoan embedded in the rock.

Hi Chanalle,
Thanks for your email. Your son seems to have found a brachiopod, likely of a kind called a spiriferid. Brachiopods are marine invertebrates that are around today but go back at least 500 million years. They are not common today but at certain points in the past they were incredibly abundant, especially the Devonian Period (~409-354 million years ago). The Devonian rocks of New York are widespread and famous for their brachiopods. So my best guess is that this is a Devonian spiriferid and is at least 354 million years old. By comparison, the oldest known dinosaur is about 245 million years old. Nice find!

I think this may be a fossil because the bone is now a hard substance. The teeth remind me of an herbivore. Are either of these assumptions correct?

Fossil Herbivore Jaw Found In The Ocean

Hello, my name is Cathy and I was recommended to your site by Carl Mehling of the American Museum of Natural History. I found a jaw fragment in the surf on Holgate Beach in New Jersey.

glu Posted Yesterday, 03:04 PM
it looks like a bos primigenius jaw fragment, the ancestral progenitor of the modern ox

Harry Pristis Posted Yesterday, 03:26 PM
Hi, Cathy . . .
Welcome to the forum. 
Your find is certainly not musk ox, though I do think it is bovid -- either bison or cow (modern) -- as evidenced by the isolated stylids of the teeth. The fact there is cementum remaining on the teeth suggests to me that this is from a modern cow (cementum is preserved sometimes, but this looks quite fresh). 
Good hunting!

RichW9090 Posted Today, 12:35 AM
There is a specimen of Bos primigenius known from a find along the shore at Brigantine, unpublished.  I think the guy who found it is a member here, can't remember if it was here or another Forum I ran across him on some years ago.  The Brigantine site is a peat bed just off shore maybe 100 yards or less, and storms wash fossils up onto the beach from time to time, although I haven't collected there in 30 years.

Thank you so much for your help. Modern or primigenius, it was a fun find! 

Harry Pristis Posted Today, 12:22 PM
It's not Bos primigenius, the auroch, Cathy.  The range of the auroch never included New Jersey.
Here's an account of the range of B. primigenius from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:
Bos primigenius is Extinct. The aurochs had three subspecies: Bos primigenius primigenius from Europe and the Middle East; B. p. namadicus from India; and B. p. mauretanicus from North Africa. Only the nominate subspecies has survived until recent times.
Originally the aurochs occurred from the British Isles and southern Scandinavia, through most of Europe to northern Africa, the Middle East, central Asia and India. By the 13th century A.D., the aurochs' range was restricted to Poland, Lithuania, Moldova, Transylvania and East Prussia (The Extinction Website, 2007). The last recorded live aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the Jaktorów (Jaktorowka) Forest, Masovia, Poland (Grubb, 2005).
It is distributed worldwide under domestication (as Bos taurus), and feral populations have become established in Australia, New Guinea, the United States, Colombia, Argentina and many islands, including Hawaii, Galápagos, Hispaniola, Tristan da Cunha, New Amsterdam, Juan Fernandez Islands, and the United Kingdom (Chillingham cattle).

RichW9090 Posted Today, 12:41 PM
As I said, there is a specimen of the auroch from the Brigantine site.  It was identified by Roger Wood from Stockton College.  It is unknown if this is the only record of B. primigenius from North America, or might have been something tossed into the sea - fossils do get lost.  That's one of the reasons why Roger never published it, I suspect.

Hi Cathy,
Thanks for your email. I think you may have something pretty cooler there! And you are right that it’s an herbivore and it certainly has the appearance I would expect of a fossil from that context. My best guess is that it is a bison or possible a musk ox. And if we are on the right track here, it would be from the Ice Age. Fossils from that time period do occasionally show up on NJ beaches and dredged up off the shore. The shoreline back then was much farther out to sea so land animal fossils can turn up here in seemingly odd places. We currently don’t have anyone here who specializes in bovids who could confirm this ID but you should try posting it to the Fossil Forum to see what they say. The Forum is a diverse and adept group of amateurs and professionals. And if I have all of this correct, this would actually be a quite rare find! Let’s see what happens.

Hi Sterling,
Thanks for your email. The majority of your fossils appear to be fragments of turtle shell and crocodilian osteoderms. Osteoderms are pieces of bone under the skin that can serve as armor or muscle attachments. Most of the flat or partly flat pieces would be the turtle bones and the ones with the circular dimples are the osteoderms. The one bone you show as two pieces might be a limb bones from a turtle – I’m not entirely sure. If you know where they came from I might be able to give you an approximate age but since turtles and crocs have been around for a very long time an age would be a wild guess without locality info.

Hello Mystery Person,
Thanks for your email. What you have is a vertebral epiphysis of a mammal. Bones often begin as several parts that fuse together as they mature. Vertebra have a large spool-shaped part capped on both ends (where they articulate to the next vertebrae) by epiphyses that fuse on to it as the vertebra matures. Your find is an epiphysis that did not fully fuse to the vertebral body. Based on the fact that you found it on the shore, and that fact that it is so round, it could easily be from a dolphin. Even when the animal is fully mature, dolphins and other whales can have vertebrae with unfused epiphyses. And based on how white it is I would guess that it is fully modern, i.e., not a fossil. Nice find!

Hi Kellie,
Thanks for your email. It looks like you have 2 fossil bones there. Might you be digging in the local Late Cretaceous sediments? If so, the first one (the long one) could be a turtle bone but that’s a pretty loose guess. It doesn’t have features that exactly recall anything to mind. The second one is a vertebra of some sort. I feel like I’ve seen sawfish vertebrae that were very much like yours but that, too, is not a very confident ID. Sorry for the vagueness, but nice finds! Keep digging.

Hi,
On a recent trip home (upstate ny) I refound something that I had picked up as a child on the shore of Seneca lake. I've always thought it looked like a fossilized tooth, although one with odd layering in the rock. I didn't have a ruler to hand when I took the pictures but it's about an inch long. I know it may well not be a fossil at all but any information about it would be greatly appreciated!

Hi Brenna,
Thanks for your message. I agree that you have a fossil but it's not a fossil tooth. It's very likely a horn coral. Horn corals were solitary corals that lived on Earth from the Ordovician to the Permian (as old as ~500 million years and as young as 250). And unless this was brought into the Seneca Lake area from farther north by glaciers, it would probably be Devonian in age (~354-409 million years ago) since all the local rocks Devonian. By comparison the oldest known dinosaurs are about 245 million years old. Nice find!

Hi Amy,
Thanks for your email. The first bone may be a turtle limb bone. It’s a bit hard to read. It may be fossil or it may be modern. If you tap it on a ceramic cup and it makes a very sharp “tink tink” sound it might be heavily mineralized, which would make it more likely to be a fossil. If the tapping sound is more like a “tock tock,” chances are it is modern. The other piece is a fang of a fish called Enchodus. Enchodus is the most common bony fish found in Big Brook. Nice finds!

All I can say is that makes it more likely to be a fossil. The interpretation of that sound is a bit subjective. Plus mineralization doesn’t always mean it’s old enough to be a fossil. Sorry we can’t be more definitive.

The best way to have things IDed is to put them in the hands of a local expert. You should try the folks at the Field Museum. I know they have had a long history of helping Mazon Creek fossil hunters. There are not really test labs for fossil identification - nothing can replace the eyes of an expert.

Hi Shane,
Thanks for your emails. The first photos you sent me are of a fossil but it did not come from Arizona. It came from Morocco. Those are straight-shelled nautiloids, sometimes called Orthoceras or orthocones. They are Devonian in age (~354-409 million years old) and have been dressed up for commercial sale. The rock surrounding each large nautiloid was polished along with areas of rock with no obvious nautiloid in order to enhance the look of the piece. These are extremely common on the fossil market. If you are anywhere near Tucscon this might have been tossed from the huge annual rock, mineral, and fossil show they have each year. Do a Google image search for “moroccan orthoceras” and you’ll find many images. The second set of photos you sent are of an ammonite. These are also shelled cephalopods and they went extinct around 65 million years ago. The center whorls of your specimen seem like they have been carved to enhance their detail – a very common alteration of commercial specimens.

Carl Mehling- Sir, Please identify this fossil if possible. I have had local amateur and professionals inspect and none can say what this is. Some have ideas but are unwilling to say with certainty exactly what it is. I acquired this at a local garage sale and was told by the seller it came from an Indian campfire in Wyoming found by her now deceased father. She later recanted the story when I inquired further of it and now I have nothing to go on as to where it's from and when it came to her fathers hands.  On the ends it appears to be fossil wood, the sides are unlike wood and have a black coating on parts of them and appear to be smooth as bone. If you can view the broken middle it looks black as coal suggesting it has been lying in this stuff and that is the preserving agent. It has been suggested it is from an mammal not of the new world but of Europe-Asia. Please contact me with your expert opinion and if you need more information or photos I will send them.

Carl-  Thanks again for your quick response- you are an exception in this world of requests for information. The woolley rhino theory has been suggested by two local paleo people. At the Hot Springs S.D. Mammoth site there is a woman who works there from Russia. She has experience with these animals in Russia and so I sought her out last week. Upon examination she at first would not comment, then we told her what some others had thought it is and then she said that's what she initially was thinking. After reexamining, she was undecided indicating that it is inconclusive in that the sides were smooth and that in her experience they should have individual hair like lines. A bone preparer, at the same facility- a young woman, thought it to be fossil wood. So as it stands I have 2 probable Woolley Rhinos, 1 undecided, 1 fossil wood, and now your maybe one or the other. This is sort of like a quest for me to find the actual answer and I will continue to seek answers until it will be positively identified if possible. To have a piece of wood in this shape suggests human shaping to me or it's very unusual to be naturally configured. The rhino theory seems plausible but maybe through fossilization  it has altered it unrecognizable in its usual form.

Hi Gerry,
These are, indeed, better photos. I can definitely see this as a piece of fossil wood where the bark or outer layer of wood has carbonized. And the cross-section shows a pattern that could easily show compressed wood. To be more sure would require polishing that face and shooting extreme close-ups. 
That said, I took a longer look at is and might slightly retract something I said earlier. It does have some similarities to the horn of a fossil rhino called Coelodonta. I don’t know what they look like in cross-section but the overall shape and the carbonized exterior are in favor of that interpretation. But there are also details that it lacks that I’d like to see in order to be more confident about that ID.
The important thing here is not to favor one idea over the other because one is more exciting. To me, rhino is more exciting than wood, and maybe to you, too. But as I stated before, the only real way to strengthen either of these views is to have an expert observe this thing in hand.

Hi April,
Thanks for your email. I think your IDs are pretty good. The shell is likely a brachiopod. They are marine invertebrates and have been on Earth for at least the last half billion years. They are still here in reduced diversity but in certain time periods they were incredibly diverse and abundant. The other one does indeed look like a coral. Many of the other round holes in that rock are likely the same. If these rocks truly did originate near Brookings they would be Late Cretaceous in age (~65-90 million years old). And at that time there was a seaway in that part of the country so everything fits together very nicely. Nice finds!

Hi James,
Thanks for your emails. Your first piece is almost certainly fossil bone. And based on where it is supposed to have been found, the color, the preservation, and the size, I have no good reason to believe it is not a chunk of dinosaur bone. Sadly, I can’t take the ID any further. It is just a fragment and lacks the specific details to say what species it came from or even what bone in the animal it is. However, the majority of dinosaur fossils up there come from hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs) with ceratopsians (horned dinosaurs) coming in for a close second. Your piece is most likely from within the Late Cretaceous and should be about 75-78 million years old.
The other piece has crinoid columnals in it. Crinoids are stemmed relatives of starfish that have been on Earth for the last half billion years or so. Their stems are composed of stacked disks of calcium carbonate that tend to disarticulate after the death of the animal. What you have are these individual disks. And the five-pointed stars in each one reflect the same five-fold symmetry seen in starfish and many other echinoderms. I don’t know Georgian Bay fossils very well but it would be  good guess that these are probably 100s of millions of years old from a time when crinoids were extremely common in the sea.
Nice finds!

Well, first off I can heartily shoot down turtle. The first turtles are way post-Silurian and the first piece has only the most superficial resemblance to a turtle. It’s hard to be sure because of what looks like a flaking mud or bacterial crust on the rock, but I’m not really getting a strong fossil signal form this one. I think it’s a purely geological design. But the one in the second email has more promise. That one looks like aquatic invertebrate bioturbation, probably marine. They look like they might be branching, which to me suggests  tunnels from burrowing crustaceans, but it’s hard to say if I’m seeing branching and it’s usually hard to say what creature made what trace fossil. This could be crustaceans, echinoderms… or just snails…

Hi Barrett,
Ooooh, that makes me happy! Your guess of tooth is spot on. By my reckoning you have a part of the upper incisor of the giant Ice Age beaver, Castoroides. Well done! These are not at all that common. And you earn extra points for having an actual fossil (most of these kinds of emails are figments), correctly guessing what it was (at least to tooth), and having the sense to use caution with your identification. You deserve such a nice fossil!

Hi Julia,
Thanks for your email. I have had a look at the photos, and although it is sometimes hard to be sure with photos, I'd be very surprised if this was a fossil egg.  It does somewhat resemble an egg, but it is much more likely to be a sedimentary concretion of some kind – it’s resemblance to an egg is merely accidental. Concretions often form when some object acts as a “seed” for cementation of sediment. The subtle concentric layering adds weight to this interpretation. On occasion, the thing that initiates the concretion, the “seed,” can be a fossil. To find this out would require finding out exactly what is in the center. 
Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine, specific kind of surface ornamentation (the smoother the ""shell,"" the less likely it is to be a non-bird dinosaur egg) or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – the more perfectly “egg-like” it is the less chance that it is a fossil egg. Ironically, one strong indication that this is not an egg is that it is so egg-shaped: most fossil eggs are not ""egg-shaped"" because most fossil eggs come from non-avian dinosaurs and are everything from spherical to torpedo-shaped. 
Additionally, the thickness of the “shell” certainly rules out egg. Embryos in hard-shelled terrestrial eggs need shells through which they can conduct gas exchange – basically so they can breathe. Past a certain thickness, this becomes impossible. This specimen’s “shell” is much too thick.
As for the other piece, the photos are very blurry. If the pattern seen in the close-ups is what he thinks is fossil that pattern is actually merely the way rocks like that fracture. 
In the future you can feel free to pass these folks directly on to me.
Best,
Carl

Hi Thomas,
Thanks for your email. Looks to me like you've found a horn coral. Horn corals were solitary corals that lived on Earth from the Ordovician to the Permian (as old as ~500 million years and as young as 250). By comparison the oldest known dinosaurs are about 245 million years old. From the little I've gathered it looks like the rocks around where you found it would be Devonian in age (from about 409-354 million years old). Either way, it would be 100s of millions of years old. Nice find!

Concretions often form when some object acts as a “seed” for cementation of sediment. On occasion, the thing that initiates the concretion, the “seed,” can be a fossil. To find this out would require cracking the concretion open. 
Alternatively, it might also be a lithified mud nodule. These start as balls of mud that harden through drying or chemical processes, sometimes at different rates within the ball. Mud nodules can also be balls of mud that affect the surrounding sediments and chemically alter them in a way that makes a shell-like layer harden and adhere to the mud interior. This can result in an object like yours with a hard “shell” and a looser interior. Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine, specific kind of surface ornamentation (the smoother the ""shell,"" the less likely it is to be a non-bird dinosaur egg) or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – the more perfectly “egg-like” it is the less chance that it is a fossil egg. But the lack of shifting in the broken bits on the surface of your find reveals the uneven geometry of the surface – this would be very unexpected for an egg..

It is much more likely to be chert nodule – it’s resemblance to an fossil is merely accidental. The type of fracture it exhibits where it has broken is very consistent with the way chert breaks.

Thanks for your email. I will have to agree with you that this is a fossil and the rock does look like sandstone. Unfortunately, there may not be enough of it preserved for me to properly ID it. My guts says that it is at least safe to say it’s likely a marine invertebrate. And I have seen fossil corals much like this. However, I can confidently rule out something from the movie Aliens, old KFC, baleen whale hair fiber, and plankton tubes. I’m unwilling to rule out any part of Bigfoot until we actually have him. And although I feel pretty strong it’s not a part of a vertebrate or trilobite that could be possible. And since, in the broadest sense, “shell” could apply to coral, I will leave that one alone.

Just for reference, the oldest known dinosaurs are around 245 million years old. And it does look like it might be a quartz replacement of the shell, or at least some kind of recrystallization. Nice find!

I was wondering if you could help me identify these specimens. I found them both outside my house in Johnson County Kentucky while walking around.
I posted the first specimen (attachments 1-2) on a fossil forum and someone identified it as a trace fossil of some kind of shelled animal (though they didn't specify what animal). I emailed it to an admin of another fossil site (based in Kentucky) to see if he could tell me what animal had left the tracks, but he thought it looked more the chambers of a straight-shelled cephalopod. What's your opinion?
I'm not sure if the second specimen (attachments 3-4) is a fossil at all, but it definitely looks like some kind of imprint. I thought it was a boot print before realizing it was in rock. A couple people suggested that it may be evidence of seafloor bioturbation, while someone else thinks it might just be a suggestive rock. Any help is appreciated!

Thanks for the reply! I agree that it looks more like a trace fossil (not that it counts for much, being a fossil newbie), but do you have any clues as to what kind? I'm leaning toward Taenidium satanassi, although I can't find much info on them (like what animal left the tracks or their presence in Kentucky).

Hi Kouga,
Thanks for your email. I can definitely see why you got the two IDs you got for that first one. It indeed looks very much like both of those things. But I would lean toward trace fossil because there does not appear to be any shell preserved, all of the sediment is quite similar, and most telling is the fact that the units vary a tiny bit in their size, which would be very unexpected for a cephalopod. But I’m not getting a strong fossil signal from the second specimen. It lacks the finer details I’d like to see in order to confidently ID it as a fossil.  Sorry I can’t be more definitive!
Best, Carl

From: Carl Mehling  Sent: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 3:07 PM To: 'Kouga' Subject: RE: Fossil ID
I think Taenidium satanassi is a good start but I don’t think that’s actually what it is. T. satanassi backfill segments contain two types of sediment (your appears to have just one) and of those two, one of them is composed of fecal pellets. But if yours is a trace fossil it is very likely a meniscate backfilled burrow like T. satanassi. Knowing the animal creator is the really hard part. The only way to confidently lock a trace fossil to its maker is for the maker to have died with the trace right after making it. This is incredibly rare. Add to this the fact that animals of very different morphology can produce very similar traces and you can see why it is best to call this maker a burrowing marine animal, probably an invertebrate.

Hi Kelsy,
Thanks for your email and your patience while I was away. You can tell your patron that he is the lucky finder of a fossil horn coral. Horn corals were solitary corals that lived on Earth from the Ordovician to the Permian (as old as ~500 million years and as young as 250 million). If it came from the rocks locally exposed near Geneva (rather than being brought there by people or glaciers) it would be Devonian in age (between about 354 and 409 million years old). By comparison the oldest known dinosaurs are only about 245 million years old. Nice find!

Dear Carl,
First I need to apologize for the lateness of this thank you for our informative, humorous and charming visit with you August 25 at the museum.  Since we met, we have been away, I had knee surgery, and then we had trouble figuring out how to get these photos online.
As you can see in the photos of smiling faces, they had a ball meeting you.  They each loved the personalized dedication in their book....you are certainly a special guy!!!
We really enjoyed the ""Life at the Limits""  that you so graciously led us to.  We would not have known it was there since we have a ritual of where we go in the museum.  It would have been a sin to miss it because the older three (12,11,and 10) took their pads and took notes for over an hour.....that is how enthralled they were.  We actually had to drag them away for lunch because Sebastian at 8 was hungry and wanted to go see the big bears.
I have enclosed photos of our molars and we had a couple of questions. We believe you said they were from a mastodon as Charles of Littleton, N.H. claimed at his museum and not a mammoth.  Is that right?  Each family is going to have one for safe keeping and of course they all like the one where you can see teeth.  You said ""the best one"" is a personal thing and they were both wonderful for different reasons.  What is the reason for each.....the first one is the one with three deep ridges and the second one has the visible teeth.  This info will help whichever sister/brother combination gets the one without teeth showing. 
The last photo shows the brown filler that must have put on so the fossil would sit properly to be displayed.  The photo with both of them shows how they must have looked displayed.  
We'll appreciate the answers to our questions because then we will do a blind behind the back division of these treasures.  They may take turns sharing them, too.
The sate of Pennsylvania has a motto....You have a friend in Pennsylvania.  The McAdams family feels we have a friend at the AMNH.  THANK YOU.
All the best,

Hey Carolyn!
Thanks for this email and your patience while I was away. Those pictures are great! And I’m so happy the kids had such a blast. More than an hour of notes… I wish you could know how happy that makes me. They are our replacements!
Now the teeth are definitely not mammoths. But I can only be pretty sure one is a mastodon (Mammut americanum): the smaller fragment. The other tooth is definitely a proboscidean but I get the sense it is not a true mastodon but probably in the larger group informally called mastodonts. I don’t claim to know proboscideans very well at all but gomphothere might be another possibility here. As for why each is wonderful I can only give you my perspective, of course. The Mammut tooth shows the wear pattern that illuminates the chewing mechanics of the living animal, and in a way makes this one more alive because you can see the evidence of it having been used. The other tooth is more complete and shows the full unworn cusp morphology.
Hope your knee is feeling better!

If you don’t already know, trilobites were marine arthropods that lived on Earth from about 530 million years ago to about 250 million. Isotelus is a genus of trilobite from the Ordovician (~500-439 million years ago) and the back end of a trilobite is called the pygidium. There are definitely Ordovician rocks in south central TN so that fits nicely, too. Very nice find!

Sorry, Mike. There's even let chance that it's a mummy of some kind. The pattern on the rock and the way that it weathered is very consistent with a hard metamorphic kind of rock.

Thanks for your email. What you have there is a chamber steinkern of an ammonite. If you don’t already know, ammonites are shelled relatives of octopuses that went extinct about 65 million years ago. They had coiled, chambered shells like today’s nautilus. What you have is the mud that filled one of those chambers, turned to stone, and survived the weathering that destroyed the shell material. We find very similar specimens in the Cretaceous of NJ. Yours has got to be from the Late Cretaceous whose rocks are well represented in SD. Very nice find!

A student of mine brought couple of cephalopod concretions into class, they are really cool, but I cannot identify the locality they are from (most students who bring fossils in have examples from rather obvious localities). These concretions are jet black, smooth river polished stones, one contains an ammonite that looks like Perisphinctes, the other looks like an orthocone nautiloid.

Hey Alan,
Well, I think you’re safe from the ""of course, these are from...."" stupidity inducer. I don’t recognize these at all. When I first saw the ammonite I thought maybe England, but if they are from the same place and time then that’s a no go, of course. I do know of very dark concretions like this with ammonites and other mollusks from the Upper Cretaceous of Colombia, but that, too, is confounded by the orthocone… Ooooh! I just thought of something: That “orthocone” might actually be a belemnite phragmocone! Now that would make better sense for the co-occurrence. But belemnites in concretions? Not sure I know of any localities for that. Sorry!

Hi Tyler,
Thanks for your email. You have some gorgeous things there! The first one (small, black, branching pattern on rock) is not a fossil, believe it or not. These are called manganese dendrites and they form when water carrying dissolved manganese gets into a crack in a rock and deposits the manganese in this pattern. Absolutely beautiful! The second one (The white, round design with the radiating lines) is a horn coral. Horn corals were solitary corals that lived on Earth from the Ordovician to the Permian (as old as ~500 million years and as young as 250 million). By comparison the oldest known dinosaurs are only about 245 million years old. And the last one (dots along a trough) is the mold of a branching bryozoan. Bryozoans have been on Earth for hundreds of millions of years and very often co-occur with horn corals so there is a good chance they are the same age. Great finds!

Hi Cathy,
Thanks for your email. You have what are called a septarian concretions (Google “septarian concretion” for many nice examples). It’s not a fossil in itself but rarely they may hide one in the center – to find out would require cutting or breaking it. Septarian concretions form as a ball of mud dries causing a network of cracks. Later, these cracks can fill with some mineral that cements the cracked pieces back together. Cool finds!

Just a point of interest. I went to college in River Falls, WI and my brother was a geology major there. Once he took me out to one of his favorite fossil hunting areas. At the top of a hill on one of the township roads just outside of town, there is some exposed rock in a ditch. It's filled with crinoids. Every spring, the runoff water going down into the ditch exposes more crinoids. It seems that no matter how much you pick, there's always more the following year.

Hi Tim,
Thanks for your email. Wow! What a nice fossil. It sure looks like a heteromorph ammonite to me. If you don’t already know, ammonites are shelled relatives of octopuses that went extinct around 65 million years ago. The majority of ammonites have spiral shells that rotate along a plane. But there are a variety that diverge from that geometry and spiral away from the plane, spiral more loosely on the plane, change direction, or a variety of these things. They are collectively called the heteromorphs. Most ammonite fans consider them the most interesting and confusing. I would guess yours came from the Late Cretaceous of the Dakotas or Montana  based on the colors and the fact that heteromorphs are common in those rocks. Very nice fossil!

As luck would have it, coprolites are my special expertise! If you haven’t yet paid for that specimen, don’t. There is almost no chance it is genuine. The market is absolutely flooded with non-coprolites because “dinosaur turd” is so much easier to sell than “amorphous crystalline mass” or “unidentified geologic oddity.” I always tell people “Caveat Empturd.” If you hunt for coprolites on eBay avoid anything from Utah, Washington, or anything pyritized. And anything at all identified as a dinosaur coprolite is automatically suspect as they are extremely rare for some reason. I’d be happy to have a look at anything you are considering.
Best, Carl

From: Carl Mehling  Sent: Thursday, October 29, 2015 12:42 PM To: 'Tim' Subject: RE: Can you ID this fossil?
Hmmm… The Washington one is suspect. I know these things certainly look like turds but I think that similarity is superficial. These have been debated for years and I feel that the non-coprolite camp makes the best case. I’d love to learn I am wrong on this one but right now the evidence is quite against them. Now the other one could possibly be a coprolite, but very unlikely to be from a dinosaur. So you know where it was purported to have been found?

From: Carl Mehling  Sent: Friday, October 30, 2015 11:55 AM To: 'Tim' Subject: RE: Can you ID this fossil?
Hi Tim,
I would consider the first one a pseudo-coprolite and the second one highly suspect (i.e., not likely). As I said before, genuine dinosaur coprolites are truly rare so anything for sale online is extremely suspect. I can offer you sources for genuine shark coprolites and other things however.

Hi Charles,
Thanks for your email. I have had a look at your attached photos, and although it is sometimes hard to be sure with photos, I'd be very surprised if this was a fossil egg.  It does somewhat resemble an egg, but it is much more likely to be a sedimentary concretion of some kind – it’s resemblance to an egg is merely accidental. Concretions often form when some object acts as a “seed” for cementation of sediment. On occasion, the thing that initiates the concretion, the “seed,” can be a fossil. To find this out would require cracking the concretion open. 
Alternatively, it might also be a lithified mud nodule. These start as balls of mud that harden through drying or chemical processes, sometimes at different rates within the ball. Mud nodules can also be balls of mud that affect the surrounding sediments and chemically alter them in a way that makes a shell-like layer harden and adhere to the mud interior. This can result in an object like yours with a hard “shell” and a looser interior. Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine, specific kind of surface ornamentation (the smoother the ""shell,"" the less likely it is to be a non-bird dinosaur egg) or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – the more perfectly “egg-like” it is the less chance that it is a fossil egg. 
Additionally, the thickness of the “shell” almost certainly rules out egg. Embryos in hard-shelled terrestrial eggs need shells through which they can conduct gas exchange – basically so they can breathe. Past a certain thickness, this becomes impossible. Your specimen’s “shell” is much too thick.
Sorry to bring bad news,
Carl

Hi Matt,
Thanks for your message and email. I have to agree with you 100% that this is a Carcharocles megalodon tooth. And of course that is cool just by itself. But there are other details here that are interesting. As far as I know C. megalodon teeth don’t really naturally occur on the East Coast north of Maryland, or if they do, they are exceedingly rare. Yet they have been found as far as (I think) Maine in archaeological contexts. Indians traded these teeth for a long time and for long distances, even well inland. And you’ll see that your tooth is missing the outmost prongs of its root. This kind of damage would also be very rare in nature. But if you look at the overall outline you might notice that it looks a lot like a stone projectile point. My guess is that if this was genuinely excavated from well underground it is a Carcharocles megalodon tooth that came from somewhere along the southern East Coast, was traded to more northern Indians, and fashioned into a spearpoint. Thus, it would be not only a paleontological find but an archaeological one. I would strongly suggest getting in touch with the folks at the Massachusetts Archaeological Society (http://massarchaeology.org/) and see what they suggest. Very nice find!
