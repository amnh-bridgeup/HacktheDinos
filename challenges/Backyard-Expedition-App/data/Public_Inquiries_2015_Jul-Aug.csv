Subject: Shark tooth ?
Hi my name is tommy hickey I just  called regarding a tooth that I found in the ocean on breezy pointy yesterday . We were wondering if this is actually a shark tooth and any other information you may be able to give us in this. If it would help out I can bring it by the aquarium to be looked at. Thank you again for your help.

Hi Alisa,
Thank you so much for your help with his. One of my kids just got home from soccer camp and I wanted to wait for him to get home to share it with the entire family. They are so excited that we actually found a shark tooth.  Shark week is one of their favorite weeks. The older boys are obsessed with them. My 8 year old is going around telling everyone he is a marine biologist and that's what he wants to be when he grows up. 
Yesterday June 30, 2015 at about 3:30 in the afterNoon I was waking around the shore line of the ocean in  breezy point looking for sea glass with 3 of my kids when I saw that and thought or sasses glass I picked it up and realized it was not. The more I looked at it the more I thought it was a tooth. After showing some of the people on the beach they convinced me it was a shark tooth. THats when the kids wanted to know what kind of tooth. So we called the Brooklyn aquarium this morning. 
If there is anymore information you would like I would love to give it as we are so excited hat we actually found something. 
Here is my contact information.

Jesus that's absurdly cool, Hans. A tooth like that would be a huge score in places where they are well-known. But I know of no record of any fossil shark tooth from NY and certainly not NYC! Truly special. Yes, I think it is probably Carcharodon carcharias and relatively young as fossils go. Probably Pleistocene. But, of course, there is a chance that it was lost by someone who purchased it or found it at a more likely spot down the east coast – no easy way to tell.  But it would  not be unexpected for the fauna and preservation type found in the Rockaways. Either way, I am SOOO jealous! Or…. It could just be a story, but again, we’ll never really know.
I actually collect references to NYC fossils – is there any way I could impose on you to get as much collecting data as possible from the Hickey’s (date, location, circumstances of collection, etc.)? You don’t think they’d consider donating it, do you?
Look at the attached image of another surprise I found on New Year’s Day on Rockaway! Thanks and I so look forward to hanging again!

You might have missed it in my earlier email but thanks so much for sharing your find with us all. What fun! And thanks for all the contextual collecting information. A tooth like that would be a very nice find in places where they are well-known. But I know of no record of any fossil shark tooth from NY and certainly not NYC. It's special merely for that reason.

Maybe it's some sort of Sandy silver lining?
I wanted to see if you might consider donating it to our collections here? I know that's a lot to ask since you only just found it, but in trade I'd like to offer you all a private trip to a fossil site I work in NJ where you are basically guaranteed a bunch of fossil shark teeth. They will be smaller but much older ones (72 million years old as opposed to 10 thousand) and will likely include a shark many consider to be an ancestor of Carcharocles megalodon called Cretalamna appendiculata. And contrary to what Shark Week may insist, I sense that most paleontologists no longer consider Carcharocles as closely related to Carcharodon. But it looks like Shark Week may actually be a bit better this year: http://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8886743/shark-week-2015-science. 
Please let me know what you think and be well.

Hey Carl!
Got your email last week.  Martha and I were away for a week for a family wedding and then returned to an extremely busy Aquarium.  Will work with Martha to arrange a play date for all of us.  Meanwhile, our vet Harley received the email below from some folks in Breezy Point (the Rockaways near where M & I live) who apparently found the shark tooth in the attached pictures on the beach.  Looks like a Carcharodon or Carcharocles of some spp or the other, but figured you could do much much better. 
Know these things are fairly common, and that you find lotsa stuff in NJ.  Is Breezy Point worth exploring (or are you familiar with the Rockaways as a good shark tooth spot)?

Thank you so much.  The photo and email are actually the result of a ‘cold call’ that got transferred to me at the Aquarium this morning.  I just happened to answer and then asked Tom to take some photos and email them to me so I could pass them to Hans.  Had no idea this would be so interesting – and yes, I agree, it’s hard to know the real story but it seemed genuine enough.  I just have the email address below for the family and what he told me on the phone about finding it at Breezy Point.  
Would you want me to simply pose the questions below to him or could I pass along some sort of contact information for you as well in case they are interested in donating?  I’m fine with either.

Dear Tom and Family,
I wanted to let you know that we were able to forward your photos of the tooth you found to a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, Carl Mehling. He believes this is a probably the fossilized tooth from a Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias), possibly from the Pleistocene era.   I have copied Carl on this email because he thinks this tooth is a pretty amazing find.  He also collects references to New York City fossils - and was wondering if you would be willing to share some more information about where, when and how you found this tooth?  I had the little information you had shared with me below, but thought you might be willing to maybe tell him more about how/where you found it?
Congratulations on a pretty incredible find.  
All the best,
Alisa

Hey Carl.  Yes Harley and I thought that tooth was absurdly cool too, and I was surprised at the location where it was found.  We discussed the possibility that was found or purchased elsewhere, and either someone dropped it on the beach or the story of its discovery was fabricated; but this is a family with 6 little kids, so the fabrication idea is unlikely.  
I know The New York Bight is an area where Carcharodon carcharias is found in all age classes and both genders, so the ID and location shouldn't surprise me.
I am sure these people would love to hear from you.  Meanwhile, Martha and I want to hang--as do a number of other people at the Aquarium after hearing about my ultra cool bud at the AMNH (Kayla still gushes when she talks about the incredible day she had in your digs).

Thanks for your email. What you have there is a foraminiferal limestone. Foraminifera (or just forams) are amoeboid protists that have a shell. They have been on Earth for over 500 million years. I know that there are Eocene limestones in Egypt famous for their forams but there seems to be no way to confirm yours. Is this built into something in the park? Best, Carl

Hello, Carl --
Online at the American Museum of Natural History website, I found an invitation to submit a fossil specimen for possible identification, and I have a good one for you! (Please see attached photos.)
This fossil was purchased by me at a recent yard sale in Southern California; however, the previous owner claimed he personally collected it in Montana back in the 1950s. The piece measures approximately 10"" x 8"" x 6"", and weighs about 15 lbs. 
My brother is a geologist, and he confirmed that it’s definitely fossilized bone, and from the size and shape, probably dinosaur. Also, he said the piece might possibly be more than one bone fused together.
If possible, I'd love to know the species of dinosaur and what part of the skeleton this is from. Maybe T-Rex? (One can dream, eh?)
Many thanks in advance for your time and attention!

Id Requested! Dinosaur Fossil? T-Rex?
Kiev Posted 02 July 2015 - 02:55 PM
Hello -- this is my first post, so many thanks in advance for your time and expertise!
I recently purchased a dinosaur fossil at yard-sale, and the previous owner said it was personally collected by him in Montana back in the 1950s; that’s about all I know about where this piece comes from. The piece measures approximately 10"" x 8"" x 6"", and weighs about 15 lbs. 
Unfortunately, I don't know any paleontologists; but, I did show it to a geologist who confirmed that it’s definitely fossilized bone, and from the size and shape, probably dino. Also, he said the piece might possibly be more than one bone fused together.
So, my questions for you are: from what dinosaur species; and which part of the skeleton? Personally, I'm thinking T-Rex . . . !
Cheers!

Troodon Posted 02 July 2015 - 07:54 PM
Welcome to the forum. Boy I'm having trouble getting a handle on your bone. There is nothing diagnostic about it other than its big and bulky. T-rex bones would not be this massive. Do you know anything more about where it was found other than Montana? 

Kiev Posted 02 July 2015 - 08:13 PM
Hi, Troodon! Thanks for chiming in. I've shared everything I know (which isn't much) about this specimen in my initial post, so that's it.  My best guess is that it's a partial fragment -- maybe some kind of blade-shaped bone? I should probably upload more pix to show the curvilinear quality of its shape . . . I'm surprised to read that it might be too big to be T-Rex! Really? Maybe brontosaurus, then? Also, I think we should consider the area of origin suspect; It might not be from Montana at all -- that's just what the old man who sold it to me claimed. Meanwhile, we're both stumped, I guess!

Troodon Posted 02 July 2015 - 08:27 PM
It's probably a partial of a leg bone. One option could be from a Ceratopsian if its from Montana. Maybe the images can ring a bell with others.

I wouldn't be too big for a T.rex, just too dense. Theropods were lightly built, with highly pneumaticized skeletons; light and quick, like a bird.

Auspex: Aha! Now that makes sense -- thanks! So, we must deduce that it belongs to something large and slow . . . ?

Interesting bone. I am also stumped. The preservation is not typical of the Hell Creek Fm, so it may not be dinosaur. Some of the pix look like titanothere atlas (neck bone)... But that is just a guess.

Thanks – these are much better. From what I can see it doesn’t look like any fossil of which I can think. It appears to be a cavity in the host rock that has partially filled with some light, maybe chalky mineral. It’s lacking the details I would want to see to confidently identify it as a fossil.

Gramps is certainly not going nutty, unless nutty = curious. 
So I showed it to my mineralogical colleague and she also had no good explanation for it. It could’ve been a pocket in the rock that filled with the lighter material. Or the lighter inclusion might have existed as a rock prior to being enveloped by the grey material. I think we’ll (sadly) have to leave it as a geological oddity for now!

Dear Dr.,
In the early 2000's, we vacationed at Kure Beach, NC, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
During one trip, I found several fossilized bones in the tidal pools north of the Fort Fisher beaches. The fort sand ramparts were partially preserved and a cove-like beach southeast of these ramparts,with tidal pools,  collects heavier objects.
The object that I found appears to be a fossilized rib , that has signs of human workmanship, at both ends of the rib. Alternate edges of the rib had been sharpened, and one end has been more worn down by some unknown process.
I have attached several photos, for your review.

Hi David,
You inquiry was forwarded to me. I have to agree that it's probably a fossil bone, but of what is hard to say. My gut says whale because they are large and commonly found as fossils along those beaches. I think it is at least safe to say it's a large mammal. But I say 'probably fossil' because I have found a good many bones along our beaches up here that are that color and are clearly modern. If this is modern, the cut marks would easily be described as marks from a butcher's saw. If you tap it with metal or ceramic and it makes a 'clink' rather than a 'click' it is more likely to be a fossil. If it is a fossil the cut marks would not be butcher marks because the fossil vertebrates found there predate people by a long shot. The marks would then be tooling by people of almost any time period on a long-ago mineralize bone for some likely-unknowable purpose. Sorry I can't be of more help.

Hi Dave,
I seriously doubt there is such a thing. There is just so much variation and subtlety that it would be phenomenally complex to create something like that. However, I can think of one book that might be somewhat helpful: What Your Fossils Can Tell You: Vertebrate Morphology, Pathology, and Cultural Modification by Robert. W. Sinibaldi.

To my eye these rocks look metamorphic in nature, which is consistent with NH and very inconsistent with fossils. You should try to get a copy of Roadside Geology of Vermont and New Hampshire (Roadside Geology Series) by Bradford B. Van Diver.

Dear Carl,
During a recent visit to a construction-site excavation in the west of Manhattan, I came across a large bone. Photographs of the bone are attached. The bone was in an organic clay deposit, most likely a former tidal marsh, overlying glacial till, about 15 to 20 feet below the existing ground level. Bivalves were also in the organic clay and I've included a photograph of them in case it helps date the bone.
The bone is quite large, and I would be fascinated  to know what you think owned it, and how old it might be. I have more photographs, if they would be useful, let me know and I'll sent them across.

Hi Rick,
Thanks for your email. Looks like you have a huge pile of bryozoans there. Bryozoans are colonial marine animals that have been on Earth for at least the last half a billion years. These look like branching bryozoans, which were attached to the sea floor or some other substrate in life and broke up into bits like this after dying and being broken up in the surf. Your specimen represents an accumulation of bryozoan bits on the sea floor.
It looks like all the rocks north of Lexington for quite a distance are Ordovician in age so if that rock wasn’t somehow transported into that area your fossils are between about 440 and 500 million years old! Just for perspective the oldest known dinosaurs are from about 243 million years ago. Nice find!

Hi Peter,
Thanks for your email. I had a look at your photos and your instincts are correct – they are not fish. My first thought was that they were straight-shelled nautiloids (or orthocones). These are relatives of today’s nautilus that were on Earth from about 240-520 million years ago. However, I found attached photo 1 of the very same fossils (labeled “squid fossils,” which is quite close to calling them nautiloids) online plus attached photo 2 also from Musandam that convince me that they are actually tall-spired snails. See the attached pdf [Kollmann H. A. 2014. — The extinct Nerineoidea and Acteonelloidea (Heterobranchia, Gastropoda): a palaeobiological approach. Geodiversitas 36 (3): 349-383.] for similar examples. Yours would be longitudinal sections naturally exposed by the weathering of the host limestone. Beautiful, aren’t they?

Hi Tara,
Thanks for your email. This time, we are definitely going to go with your 12-year-old: that is a fossil coral. But I can certainly see the strong resemblance to something like a honeycomb as well. However, you can easily rule out a bee structure because of the fine radiating lines within each compartment - this is classic coral structure. I know of a single fossil honeycomb and a possible partial wasp's nest in amber against simply incredible numbers of coral fossils. The reasons for this discrepancy are: 1) corals have been on Earth for 100s of millions of years and bees probably less than 100 million, 2) even when both were around together there were almost certainly many more corals that bee structures, 3) corals live in an environment very friendly to the formation of fossils whereas bee structures are created in an environment generally hostile to fossil preservation, and 4) corals are made of easily preserved hard minerals whereas bee structures are far more fragile. Finally, the rocks in Indiana are way too old to preserve bee structures: depending on where you found this (and assuming it wasn't moved by people or glaciers) your fossil coral is probably between 324 and 500 million years old! Nice find!

Hi Jessica,
I have had a look at your attached photos, and although it is sometimes hard to be sure with photos, I'd be very surprised if this was a fossil egg.  It does indeed resemble an egg, but it is much more likely to be a weathered rock of some kind – it’s resemblance to an egg is merely accidental. 
Fossil eggs do usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine surface ornamentation (the smoother the ""shell,"" the less likely it is to be a non-bird dinosaur egg) or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. But both the ""shell"" here and the bumpy texture are inconsistent with what one would expect for a fossil egg. The bumpy part actually looks like a coarse limestone, which also wouldn't be consistent with a fossil egg.
Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – the more perfectly “egg-like” it is the less chance that it is a fossil egg. Ironically, one strong indication that this is not an egg is that it is so egg-shaped: most fossil eggs are not ""egg-shaped"" because most fossil eggs come from non-avian dinosaurs and are everything from spherical to torpedo-shaped.

Ooooh, you beat me to it, Tim! Yeah, I’d say it has had at least some life in a river.
Sometimes hard to be sure with photos, I'd be very surprised if this was a fossil egg.  It does indeed resemble an egg, but it is much more likely to be a sedimentary concretion of some kind – it’s resemblance to an egg is merely accidental. Concretions often form when some object acts as a “seed” for layered cementation of sediment. On occasion, the thing that initiates the concretion, the “seed,” can be a fossil. To find this out would require cracking the concretion completely open – this one is broken but the true center is still hidden. 
Alternatively, it might also be a lithified mud nodule. These start as balls of mud that harden through drying or chemical processes, sometimes at different rates within the ball. Mud nodules can also be balls of mud that affect the surrounding sediments and chemically alter them in a way that makes a shell-like layer harden and adhere to the mud interior. This can result in an object like this with a hard “shell” and a looser interior. Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine surface ornamentation (the smoother the ""shell,"" the less likely it is to be a non-bird dinosaur egg) or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – the more perfectly “egg-like” it is the less chance that it is a fossil egg. Ironically, one strong indication that this is not an egg is that it is so egg-shaped: most fossil eggs are not ""egg-shaped"" because most fossil eggs come from non-avian dinosaurs and are everything from spherical to torpedo-shaped. 
Additionally, the thickness of the “shell” almost certainly rules out egg. Embryos in hard-shelled terrestrial eggs need shells through which they can conduct gas exchange – basically so they can breathe. Past a certain thickness, this becomes impossible. This specimen’s “shell” is much too thick. It could also just be a rock that has been rounded by being bounced around in a river. ""Egg"" shapes are extremely common among river rocks. However, the fact that it is layered the way it is points more strongly towards concretion.
Finally, Washington is only known for a single dinosaur fossil, and that was only recently found. Of course that doesn’t mean there couldn’t be more but their extreme rarity makes eggs almost out of the question.

Hi Randy,
Thanks for your email. I’ve had a look at your photos. I’m sorry but I don’t think either of them is a fossil.
The first one does somewhat resemble an egg, but it is much more likely to be just a weathered piece of limestone – it’s resemblance to an egg is merely accidental. However, if it is limestone, this little bits it is made of could be small marine invertebrate fossils.  Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine, specific kind of surface ornamentation or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Both of those seem to be missing here. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – the more perfectly “egg-like” it is the less chance that it is a fossil egg. 
The other piece appears to be a chunk of ironstone. Where I collect fossils in NJ we are constantly tormented by these whimsical shapes that ironstone has a nasty habit of presenting.
Sorry to bring bad news,
Carl

Thanks for your email. I certainly wouldn't be able to authenticate something like this exclusively from photos but my eye and my gut tell me that one should be suspicious about this specimen. This definitely looks like something from Morocco and the Moroccans are well-known for their trilobite fakes. Have a look at the links below.

Hey Carl.
My name is John. So, some years ago I found a fossil. I've thought it's of a fish, maybe, a vertebrate or a shoulder blade. Something.
I'll send some pictures. It seems like it contains both calcium and mineral, so it's got some time behind it. But its still in its earIy stages. I found it here in New York while walking down the beach some time after Hurricane Sandy destroyed the Rockaway Boardwalk. I'd like to learn more about it.
I can send some more pictures if you'd like.

Hi John,
Thanks for your email. By the look of it you have a bone there. And by the way it has broken it appears to be mineralized, and thus old, and thus a fossil. The texture of the bone makes me think it is a mammal bone but it looks very weathered, which means the overall shape may not be very similar to the original overall shape. Now, there are young fossils (up to 12,000 years old) found on that beach from time to time and they do include marine mammal bones. My best guess is that you have a chunk of  marine mammal bone, maybe a dolphin. I know of no way to tell for certain. Not sure what the “critters” might be but if they were marine things that were living in it from when it was in the ocean they’d all be dead by now. I wish I could tell you more because one of my favorite topics is NYC fossils!

Please could you see the attached images and advise whether you think this is a fossil or just a stone (septarian concretion)?
The object is quite light for its size weighing 180 grams and doesn’t have the feel of a stone/rock to touch.
To those that have handled it, it has the appearance and feel of a fossilised crushed egg, but I know that these types of things are often mistaken.
Apologies there is no clear photo of the height, but photo image 1232 just about gives you an idea of thickness on the left hand side which is slightly raised.

Hi Tom,
Thanks for your email. I have had a look at your attached photos, and although it is sometimes hard to be sure with photos, I'd be very surprised if this was a fossil.  It does somewhat resemble an egg, but it is much more likely to be a sedimentary concretion of some kind (as you propose) – it’s resemblance to an egg is merely accidental. Concretions often form when some object acts as a “seed” for cementation of sediment. On occasion, the thing that initiates the concretion, the “seed,” can be a fossil. To find this out would require cracking the concretion open. 
Alternatively, it might also be a lithified mud nodule. These start as balls of mud that harden through drying or chemical processes, sometimes at different rates within the ball. Mud nodules can also be balls of mud that affect the surrounding sediments and chemically alter them in a way that makes a shell-like layer harden and adhere to the mud interior.  Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine surface ornamentation (the smoother the ""shell,"" the less likely it is to be a non-bird dinosaur egg) or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits. Ironically, one strong indication that this is not an egg is that it is so egg-shaped: most fossil eggs are not ""egg-shaped"" because most fossil eggs come from non-avian dinosaurs and are everything from spherical to torpedo-shaped. 
But most vexing is the comment “quite light for its size… and doesn’t have the feel of a stone/rock to touch.” I agree that by the look of this, one should expect more heft than you report. It makes me wonder if this isn’t artificial: maybe a collapsed rubber ball or some plastic thing. I have definitely seen rubber break down fairly similarly. You might want to take a match to it and see what happens.
Best,
Carl

Thanks for your email. Looks to me you’ve got yourself a Calamites fossil there. Calamites was an ancient relative of today’s horsetails and grew to be up to 100 feet tall.

Thanks for your email. I would agree that what you found is a fossil but I'm having trouble doing much better than that! Based on the type of fossils common on Lake Michigan's shores, I feel strongly that this would be a marine invertebrate of some kind and would be hundreds of millions of years old. You should post this to the Fossil Forum for identification: They are an extremely adept group of professional and amateur paleontologists and should have more to add here.
Best,
Carl

	I’m attaching some photos of an interestingly shaped “rock” specimen I found in the Difficult Run stream in Northern Virginia.  It is circa 5 inches in length. On the odd chance it might be a fossilized skull of a small raptor — rather than a uniquely eroded piece of quartz aka “faux-sil"" — I thought it best to seek an expert opinion before I toss it.  I know such a find would be rare.  And if it were a fossil it would appear to be of the ""preserved flesh"" type which I understand would be even more rare.  Look forward to your response — whether “just a rock” or possible fossil worth further inspection.  Thanks and regards.  Dave

Hello Carl Mehling,
I am a Summer Associate at Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy. One of the big projects I am currently working on are classroom fossil displays for our new education center. All of the fossils came out of the park, and I've done my best (googling) to try and figure out what they are. In total, I have six displays with approximately nine fossils (though not all are unique) in each display. I was wondering if you could help me with some of the identification, and if so, what would be the best method to present the fossils to you, as there are quite a few. 
Thanks so much,

Hi Krista,
Wow… This is a lot to look at. Some are pretty hard to make out and some may not even be fossils but I can’t be sure from the photos. However the overwhelming majority appear to be brachiopods. Brachiopods are marine invertebrates with 2 shells that at first glance look at lot like clams but are only distantly related and quite different. Brachiopods have been around for at least the last 540 million years and persist today. But during some time periods, like the Devonian, they were wildly abundant. I can’t at all be sure but I’d bet yours are Devonian and the rocks they are in were probably brought in from somewhere upstate. There is practically no chance that they originated in NYC. As for the sparkly material, I don’t recognize it but it is probably some mineral that filled in a void in the sediments that contained the brachiopods.
Best, Carl

Hi Krista,
Sadly, I am no brachiopod expert and we currently have none here at the AMNH. So our brachiopod IDs can’t go any further.
4 & 9 definitely look like brachiopods to me.
17 & 19 are very hard to read but I think they are also a brachiopods. I don’t see a blastoid.
28 might be a bivalve or a brachiopod. Very hard to read. But it wouldn’t be a Gryphaea as that genus only goes back to the Jurassic and I definitely feel that these fossils are Paleozoic.
34 is extremely hard to read and may not actually be a fossil. I see no echinoderm.
Sorry I can’t be more definitive!

Hi Michael,
Thanks for your email. Looks like you found a stigmarian rhizomorph (often referred to as Stigmaria) of a lycopsid (club moss) tree. Lycopsids (such as Sigillaria and Lepidodendron) were one of the main ingredients in the PA coal that helped fire the Industrial Revolution. They were exceptionally common in the Pennsylvanian Period (~ 299-323 million years ago) and, as you know, this is the age of the Mazon Creek fossils. You'll sometimes hear stigmarian rhizomorph called “roots,” but these giant lycopsids weren't like modern trees in several respects (that's one of the things that makes them so interesting). If I have my head screwed on right, the rhizomorphs were support structures like modern tree roots but they were often photosynthetic, unlike modern tree roots. Many reconstructions have them exposed at the surface or in shallow water to they could access the sunlight. The dimples all of your specimen are where smaller rootlike structures radiated out from the rhizomorph. Typically, rhizomorphs are preserved as casts, not truly petrified remains, and yours has that look about it. Google “Stigmaria” for many images of these fossils. Nice find!
Best, Carl

It would be hard and heavy whether it was a cast or petrified. The only real way to tell would be the break/cut it transversely and observe the micro-texture. Polishing would certainly help here.

Dear Mr. Carl Mehling, 
During an excursion with my children today, August 4, 2015, I discovered two pieces of shale that featured what appear to be fossilized remains of some kind. Both pieces came from the same location along the base of the northern end of a quarry pit, Route 487 on Red Rock Mountain, within Ricketts Glen State Park, PA. 
Immediately upon finding the pieces, I noticed both had impressions of a scaly, reptilian type texture, similar to a snake's skin. Knowing that prehistoric animal fossils aren't too common in Pennsylvania, as opposed to plant fossils, I wanted to try and determine if these samples are indeed from an animal of some kind.

Hi again, David. Thanks for your patience. Your fossils look like Coal Age plants. 
The first is either a stigmarian rhizomorph (often referred to as Stigmaria) of a lycopsid (club moss) tree or a large branch from the same kind of tree. Lycopsids (such as Sigillaria and Lepidodendron) were one of the main ingredients in the PA coal that helped fire the Industrial Revolution. They were exceptionally common in the Pennsylvanian Period (~ 299-323 million years ago). 
You'll sometimes hear stigmarian rhizomorphs called “roots,” but these giant lycopsids weren't like modern trees in several respects (that's one of the things that makes them so interesting). If I have my head screwed on right, the rhizomorphs were support structures like modern tree roots but they were often photosynthetic, unlike modern tree roots. Many reconstructions have them exposed at the surface or in shallow water to they could access the sunlight via radiating, smaller rootlike structures. If yours is a rhizomorph, the ‘fuzz’ extending beyond the main structure would be these smaller structures. If this is a branch, these represent the thin, straplike leaves of the tree. 
The other specimen is harder to read but is likely the periderm of this same kind of tree. The periderm was the exterior, photosynthetic covering of the tree’s trunk.
Nice finds! Best, Carl

Hi Jeffrey,
Thanks for your email. The photos are a bit hard to make out – they’re a bit fuzzy and the lighting is poor. But I think I am seeing a trilobite there. Trilobites are marine arthropods that lived on Earth from about 550-250 million years ago. If I’m seeing a trilobite what you have is the front half. And I can’t claim to know my trilobites very well but it could be something quite like Olenellus (https://www.google.com/search?q=olenellid&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAkQ_AUoA2oVChMI5ZmR9MOwxwIVwTs-Ch1QGAdz&biw=1663&bih=989#nfpr=1&tbm=isch&q=olenellus). Trilobites of this kind are extremely old and rocks of this age do not occur on Cape Cod. In all likelihood, again, if this is a trilobite, it was transported from somewhere to the north by glaciers. Finding its true age would be very tricky. Can you maybe take some sharper pictures in sunlight? And strong light from the side could also bring up some details.

The majority of the fossils in there (the circles, tubes, and rectangles) are molds of crinoid columnals. Crinoids are stemmed relatives of starfish that go back 100s of millions of years and are still found in today's seas, and columnals are the individual stacked elements of their stems. You also have at least one sea shell (a bivalve or a brachiopod) in there: the feathery-looking mark. The rocks of northeastern OK are all of Carboniferous in age (~300-350 million years old) and this works perfectly for a time when crinoids were incredible abundant. Nice find!
Best,
Carl

Hi Rich,
I have had a look at your attached photos, and I'd be very surprised if this was a fossil egg.  It somewhat resembles an egg, but the preservation and rock type are all wrong. The chips along the edge are what are called conchoidal fractures and are seen in obsidian, common glass, quartz, and other similar materials. These materials are unlike those found in genuine fossil eggs. Also, the ‘dings’ on the opposite face agree with a glassy material. Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine surface ornamentation or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – the more perfectly “egg-like” it is the less chance that it is a fossil egg. Your specimen lacks these eggshell features. Ironically, one strong indication that this is not an egg is that it is so egg-shaped: most fossil eggs are not ""egg-shaped"" because most fossil eggs come from non-avian dinosaurs and are everything from spherical to torpedo-shaped. 
Sorry to bring bad news,
Carl

Looks like where you found it is in the Kvartar, which has to be the Quaternary. And since mammoths went extinct in the early part of the Quaternary, the tooth must be Pleistocene in age (~10,000-1.8 million year old). You should go out and look for more fossils while the water is low!

I picked this piece up because it looked really strange, not thinking it was a type of fungus.

Hi Lauren,
Thanks for your email. I can certainly see a strong resemblance to a shelf fungus here. But I think it is much more likely to be a calcite cave formation. The growth of calcite and the growth of shelf fungi are actually quite similar and can result in very similar shapes. Fossil shelf fungi are known but are exceptionally rare, which is one reason I am shying away from that ID. But the color, texture, and structure of the piece, especially the side opposite the “fungus” is very consistent with a calcitic cave decoration. Might there be nearby limestone deposits near where you found this?

What you have is a gorgeous horn coral. Horn corals (a type of rugose coral) lived from about the beginning of the Ordovician to the end of the Permian (~488-250 million years ago) so you have a pretty old fossil there.

Attached are pictures of one of the larger rocks with trace fossils.
We were excavating our back/side yard and found rocks of various sizes. Very interesting trace fossils we hosed them off and are keeping under our shed and some in basement. They seem too interesting to discard.
I've found some very good websites, one being http://www.crinus.info/before%20and%20after.html. I wondered if you could please tell us something about them. (Like what era, rock formation, what trace fossils are there, etc.)
We are told our neighborhood in Zelienople, PA Butler county was built 25 to 30 years ago and our house was one of the last to be built. Our neighbor speculated that much fill from our neighborhood site was dumped here mainly from other sites of neighborhood but who knows where else the rocks came from. There was a lot of light brown clay and rocks and gray clay further towards base  of approx. 15' excavation below house grade.
Any information would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you
Susan

The larger rocks are 32""x24"", The second larger rock is 29"" at it's widest width.
Many others are hand sized and some medium too.
Rock with leaves I didn't want to carry it through woods over our mountain. The last two pictures are along the Sandy Creek Bike Trail while biking the Allegheny Rails to trails in PA.
Wondered what that one might be...

Thank you so very much for your reply.
With the vast information available on the internet, I would have to be a scientist to make sense of it. The information of the rocks being Pennsylvanian will help tremendously in researching more information.
I will also try the fossil forum as well.

Hi Susan,
Thanks for your email. Sadly, I can’t readily identify any trace fossils on your slabs. They may be trace fossils but they may also be sedimentary features that have nothing to do with organisms. Trace fossils are not my forte. It does look like all of the rocks in your area are Pennsylvanian (~295-324 million years ago)  in age so if they truly are local, that would be their age. You should also post this to the Fossil Forum for identification: They are an extremely adept group of professional and amateur paleontologists and should have more to add here.
Best, Carl

Maybe there has been a lot of detail lost in the translation re computers and files I'll try and draw what I see on the image and include it. 
As far as reading is concerned I've read everything I could find on this species, books, online searches. I know that nothing has been found re dinosaur embryo…...yet. 
This is a first it has been protected by silt, sand or consumed another dinosaur and somehow preserved. 
I just kept looking at it and features kept falling into place. 
I am aware that people look at water warn rocks and imagine 'rogue test style' what they would like to see but there is just too much evidence here. Too many things in the right place. The size of the egg 4 to 6 inches typical therapod egg, this is 4 inches. It has four limbs, Large feet, smaller arms, three prominent claws on each, crocodilian snout shape, teeth, prominence down back sail area, tail is wrapped around (can't quite tell where) I can see a serrated patten on skin, it's subtle but present.
I'm going to send it to some other museums I'll let u know what they say.
To me this is the closest we have come to looking a real dinosaur apart from mummified skin and the classic bones. It's like a snap shot. I know u think I'm a kook. I must say I am a novice but keep looking at this. It's a reality. Most people I have shown it to see it, some don't. I think it's unique and exhibit worthy.

Hi Kel,
All I can really say at this point is that I have handled and seen up-close all manner of fossils and a huge number of fossil eggs and your find falls short on all the details that would confirm it as such.
Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine, and specific kind of surface ornamentation, which is lacking here, or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – I see nothing that could be described as eggshell here. Also, the entire animal with all of its flesh would be incredibly unexpected – bones would be much more likely, as rare as they are.
And as you know, Spinosaurus is only known from North Africa, so if this was found anywhere else that would also speak against this being any kind of Spinosaurus fossil.
Please do seek other opinions because mine is merely one. But have you considered how you will react if several experts echo my opinion?
Best,
Carl

Thanks for your email and your patience. The first fossil you poster looks a lot like an ammonite. Ammonites are extinct, shelled relatives of today’s octopuses. They went extinct around 65 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous. The rocks around Bandera are all Cretaceous so this fits very well. The white marks in the second specimen you posted certainly appears to be a fossil but not enough of it is exposed for me to make a worthwhile guess as to what it is. The last one appears to be a piece of chert rather than a fossil. Two out of three ain’t bad!

Thanks for your email. I've had a look at the photos and feel pretty convinced it's not a fossil turtle. There are subtle details that lead me away from seeing a turtle. In my attached image at the 3 places marked ""A"" you can see a clear, blocky, crystalline structure. I've never seen fossil bone preserve like this. Also, turtle shell bones almost never meet with four bones sharing a corner. This would form an X-shaped junction as can be seen in your find. Turtle shell bones almost always meet with three bones sharing a corner in a Y-shaped junction. Finally, the rocks in NW GA are all much older than the oldest turtle.

I have had a look at your attached photos, and although it is sometimes hard to be sure with photos, I'd be very surprised if this was a fossil egg.  It somewhat resembles an egg, but it is much more likely to be a mineral accumulation of some kind – it’s resemblance to an egg is merely accidental. It lacks several details that would make it a convincing egg fossil. Fossil eggs usually have an easily identifiable shell which differs significantly from the enclosed sediments either by having a fine, specific kind of surface ornamentation, which is lacking here, or a specific type of crystalline structure in cross-section. Also, because eggshell is so brittle, the shell is almost always heavily cracked with apparent shifting of the eggshell bits – the more perfectly “egg-like” it is the less chance that it is a fossil egg. Also, eggs have a near perfect geometry, apparent even in broken shell bits, that this piece lacks.

Hi Erin,
Thanks for your email. As soon as I opened your first image I knew we were almost certainly looking at a Pennsylvanian (~295-324 million years ago) fossil: I have collected on the other side of the water at Joggins in Nova Scotia and found much the same kind of fossils. Here is a little bit I found on the Web: http://www.capeenrage.ca/en/explore-a-beach/geology-and-fossils#!1 Your fossil is of a plant called Calamites. This was a giant relative of today’s horsetails and got to be up to 100 feet tall. What you have is a cast of the pith cavity in the center of the stem.
As for the other photos, they all appear to be fossil corals. Fossil 3 looks like a coral called Favosites. Fossil 9 appears to be a horn coral. Fossil 13 is hard to make out but I think it’s either a coral or a bryozoan. And Fossil 12 is a colonial coral of some kind. I couldn’t find anything about the fossils of Kapuskasing but Favosites was around from the Ordovician to the Permian (~250-500 million years ago). For comparison the oldest known dinosaurs are from about 245 million years ago.
Nice finds!

Carl, :D  I thought you would like the second specimen, even though incomplete and crushed.  Attached are quick and dirty images with a 1 cm scale bar.  I have images with the scale ruler in them, if needed.  I just added another rough comparative photo, too. Dr. Maisey's latest lead regarding tubular dentine is the best progress toward an ID, so far.  I've been 'ripping up' the interweb trying to find something similar.  Are there other fish, besides lungfish, I could investigate?  Also, notice the ""notch"" or ""cupped"" area on the brown end of specimen 1.  The same feature on specimen 2 is between 10 & 11 o'clock on the photo above.  It's about twice the size of specimen 1.   Anyway, I hope we can generate some interest in what is certainly a rare specimen down here in TX.  Here is the LINK to Seth's post [This showed some large lungfish teeth from Kem Kem, Morocco.]. Take care, John

John to me 4:56 PM (16 hours ago) 2 September 2015
Since we don't know what we're looking at, it's hard to judge what might be pathology.  :D  The notch on the second one could be oriented where it is because one specimen is from the ""right"" side and the second, the ""left"".  I'm not seeing much in the way of taphonomic features.  The notch in specimen 1 is the natural margin.  I've attached a few images with notations.   What are your thoughts, or questions?

It worries/excites me a bit because it’s DAMNED similar to our new NJ lungfish!

Whoa… Don’t know if I recall seeing this thing but your timing is pretty good. Just a month and a half ago I was leading a members’ trip in NJ and a boy found a chip of something quite like this that he donated and we IDed is as a chip of lungfish tooth. It is VERY similar to yours but yours, at least in my opinion, can’t be a lungfish. Very exciting. Based on what I know, I’m thinking you have a fish tooth. But I can’t do better at the moment. I’ve sent your pix to M– let’s see what he says. Wow!

I was JUST going to start writing up a small paper on the ‘lungfish’ bit but this thing certainly confounds my path. Can I convince you to let me include this specimen in the paper> If so, does it have an institutional specimen number? Are you the collector?

Thanks, John. Might you have any interest in donating any of these specimens? I’m not sure I can write about them without institutional numbers. Either way, this is very intriguing and now I really want to find out what this stuff is!

From: Carl Mehling  Sent: Friday, August 28, 2015 3:13 PM To: 'John' Subject: RE: Marine bone
Now I do seem to recall seeing these shots. The only reason I think fish tooth is because it looks basically exactly like what we have and Maisey called it ‘tubular dentine.’ We must find out what this anomaly is!

From: Carl Mehling  Sent: Friday, August 28, 2015 3:37 PM To: 'John' Subject: RE: Marine bone
That’s great, John! Getting the number before publication would be best but I’ll likely be submitting in the next 2 month and that’s asking a lot. Let me know what’s possible.
But as for similar material I honestly have no idea! Attached is the new NJ specimen and the only known Mesozoic lungfish tooth east of the Mississippi.
Also attached is an AMNH holotype of a Cretaceous fungus that was re-identified as a lungfish tooth. Very much like yours!

Hi John,
I agree – those things are all related closely somehow and we are on the trail of an unknown. Can you send me a link to Seth’s post? Can’t seem to find it.
I guess in the absence of anything better I am imagining this to be a pharyngeal tooth plate. But there are obvious problems with that. Don’t think lungfishes have something like this.
Of course, I am dying to see your new shots of the new specimen! Can I have you presmission to include some of your shot in my paper? I will, of course, credit you.
Best,
Carl

Wow wow wow… That is amazing. And your photos are superb. Thanks for letting me use them! Is there any way you could shoot a quick and dirty shot with a scale bar? All of my included shots have a 1cm scale.
I will certainly change your description in the paper. It’s going to be a very short piece on how we ID things and how we work through competing ideas.
As of yet there really isn’t much more going on that this short paper. No formal study yet. My hope is that this first paper will generate interest in a more thorough treatment. I shouldn’t borrow anything until that happens, if it does at all. I guess the specimens won’t need to be curated for this first paper but it would certainly look better. If that could happen it would be great but no pressure.
Thanks a million!

Hi John,
The email below seems to be the last email I got from you. Can you resend the shots of the 2nd specimen? And you mentioned sending the specimens? And may I use your photos in my paper with credit to you?
Below is the part of my text that you are in. Can you give it a read for accuracy?
Just two days before typing out an announcement of a new lungfish fossil I received an email from John, one of the administrators of the Fossil Forum. He sent me shots of a fossil that he’d asked me about two years prior. In the flood of fossils I see daily, I had completely forgotten ever having seen it. He was resending it because he had found another and said, “You know how it helps to revisit some mysteries after we've absorbed new info in the interim.” I did indeed.
He found the first specimen in the Albian Walnut Formation of Texas in April of 2013. Mollusks, mainly oysters, dominate this shallow marine fauna, with a few echinoids and small crustacean parts sprinkled in.  Other than the uncommon shark tooth, Jackson was unaware of any other vertebrate fossils from the site. Based on this, plus the fossil’s somewhat crustacean-like appearance, he called upon the expertise of some decapod researchers. The results were ambiguous. But then further preparation of the specimen convinced John the fossil was actually bone. My very first knee-jerk response in 2013 was that it might be a pachycephalosaur dome. These have a comparable footprint and cross-sectional grain but the context and especially the specimen’s thickness made that extremely unlikely. Then the overall shape reminded me of the pharyngeal tooth plates of some fish like the Late Cretaceous Moroccan Eodiaphyodus, but the surface texture was all wrong – those tooth plates are crowds of tiny, stacked ‘buttons’ and Jackson’s find was a solid, continuous surface of tubular dentine. Jackson had also been freeing his mind and casting a wide net: “The list of what it ‘looks like, but’ is starting to be humorous...crab, turtle, fish, dino, egg.”
Thanks a million,
Carl

Carl Mehling to John 4:09 PM (17 hours ago) 2 September 2015
Got it on gmail - thanks! Nothing on AMNH. And I tried to forward it from gmail to AMNH and failed. So odd!
I did see the correponding notch. HOPEFULLY, that'll be helpful in IDing this beast. I see a notch along what I'll call the midline and then another just to the right of it in the comparison photo. I figure the one to the right is either taphonomic or pathologic. Or am I reading it wrong? And I am figuring the notch on the new one corresponds to the midline notch on last year's.
And thanks for the Seth link, too!

Carl Mehling to John 9:59 AM (0 minutes ago) 3 September 2015
I hear you there. I think I'll leave this question alone until after (hopefully) broader interest in these is picked up. So intriguing!
Can you try send me an email to my AMNH address with no attachments as a test?

I'm submitting to the Mosasaur maybe this week. The Mosasaur is a VERY irregular journal with no real schedule so I have no good idea about when it will be out, sadly.

Hi Stan,
Unfortunately, these are much like the other shots. Polishing the face and taking a very sharp close-up should help. But right now I’m seeing neither bone nor wood. If it is a fossil my best current guess would be a filled-in burrow of some kind.

Hi,
I found a fossil washed up on the beach in California, near Malibu. At first I thought it might be just iron oxide, but I asked a friend of mine who is a paleontologist, and she said it's definitely a fossil. She could not tell me what it is however. Maybe you could shed some light on it? Attached are some photographs.

Hi Sarah,
Thanks for your email. I guess I have to agree with your paleontologist friend but I'm at a bit of a loss. I have seen both plant and fish fossils from California that looks a bit like this but I can’t even tell which I like more. My suggestion is to see if you can meet up with someone at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County for an in-person look. Not only is this better than photos, they would likely know local fossils better than we would. Good luck!

Thanks for your email. I think you may have a fossil there but I would need to see a sharp close-up to be more sure. And if you can tell me where your 'grandpa's' rock pile is, I might be able to guess its age if it turns out to be a fossil. And do you know if the rocks in the rock pile came from a place near the pile?

Hi Brittany,
It looks like the rocks around Wilson are all Ordovician on age (~439-500 million years old) so if that is a fossil it is very old. Just for comparison, the oldest known dinosaurs are around 245 million years old. Nice find!

If you are able to provide sharper, closer shots I may be able to tell. But if it isn't preserved well it may not even be possible to say definitively that it is or isn't a fossil.
